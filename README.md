<h1> DiveVR </h1>

DiveVR is an online tutoring software, which teaches science on Android and Windows based systems, focusing on students in grades 5-10.
DiveVR was created as a solution to a growing problem with todays education. As a tutor for the past 5 years, these are some of the problems I, and my students have noticed:

1. Students understand less of what is being taught, because the lessons are less engaging
2. Students are taught in a very general way (e.g one teacher, and 30 students, who are all getting the exact same material in the exact same way)

This is unfortunate, because while students in public schools are struggling, those with access to (expensive) personalized learning services, learn much faster, and better.

DiveVR was created to be a state-of-the-art personalized learning service for science.

<h2> How does it work? </h2>
DiveVR uses Microsoft Azure to personalize every aspect of a students learning experience.

First, a quick quiz helps DiveVR determine what areas of science need work and <b>how the student learns best.</b> DiveVR uses this information to create a custom learning plan, that automatically finds where a student is struggling, and assigns lessons in the proper order and difficulty to help them learn most effectivly (a very non-trival task).

As mentioned above, DiveVR also determines how a student learns best, with videos, text, or 3d models and simulations, or even a combination of these. Furthermore the algorithm continuously updates while the student is using the software, so we can even determine what sub-topics the student learns best in (e.g they learn physics best with simulations and models, but biology best with videos).

The algorithm also determines the difficulty to present the topic with (depending on the students grade, strengths etc.) DiveVR has the <b>entire Standard Science curriculum from grades 5-10 in video, 3d models and simulations, and text</b>

Lastly, before and after each lesson, students write a short quiz, which helps the algorithm determine how much they've improved, how they may learn best in the future, what needs further work, etc. Here are some examples of quiz questions:

This information is then available to students, parents and teachers, in user-friendly formats. Students, parents and teachers can also set learning goals, and manually adjust learning plans for students. Here is an example of a learning plan. Note, the user can drag and drop from to include or exclude different topics from the learning plan
as well as adjust the difficulty, or the order in which the topics appear.
