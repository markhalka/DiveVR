    //ok, so here just make a different layout for the parents
    //they should have access to student info
    //they should see how much dive points they spent and when 
    //and they should see the students level, thats pretty much it 
    //actually, you could add that to student as well
    //they should also see what prizes they orderd, to what adress and when they are coming 
    //so make a dive points class 

    //dont make a seperate scen 


    void Start()
    {

    }

    //so itll be pretty similar to student menu
    //for the dive poitns just have 

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

    }
}
