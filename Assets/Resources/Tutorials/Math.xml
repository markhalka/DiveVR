maybe just have this in the other xml file

actually you can have it here to keep it cleaner just search for the same names and done 

this would be easiest to do in an html page, then just downloading it and displaying that 

you can add styles with css, html all that, maybe just keep it on the website (keeps the download size down)
and you can just query it and display it 
you can use a plug in for unity 

for how-to stuff you can just screen shot it and put text over it, make it an image and add button with no background 
for the text
