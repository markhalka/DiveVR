          <simple>Matter</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about what matter, atoms, bonds, compounds and subatomic particles</advanced>
          <advanced>Matter is the substance of which all material is made. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.</advanced>
          <advanced>We all know when something takes up space, but what exactly is mass?</advanced>
          <advanced>Mass is simply the amount of matter in an object. If you hold a brick in one hand and a feather in your other hand, can you tell which object has more mass? </advanced>
          <advanced>The brick feels heavier, and therefor the brick has more mass. We can confirm this by using a scale to measure the mass of both objects.</advanced>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Volume</simple>
          <advanced>The amount of space that something takes up is described in a measurement called volume</advanced>
          <advanced>Measuring the volume of something depends on its shape. For example, to measure the volume of a box-shaped object, we would measure its length, width, and height. Then, we multiply these three measurements together.</advanced>
          <advanced>If the measurements are in centimeters, the unit for volume is cubic centimeters (cm3).</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Properties of matter</simple>
          <advanced>Matter can be experience with our senses, and they have different properties, let's take a look at a few of the common ones!</advanced>
          <advanced>Mass is the amount of matter in an object </advanced>
          <advanced>Volume is the amount of space an object takes up</advanced>
          <advanced>texture is what an object feels like when you touch it </advanced>
          <advanced>Hardness is the ability of an object to be scratched. For example glass can be scratched, but a diamond cannot.</advanced>
          <advanced>Flexibility is how much an object can bend before it breaks; a meter stick has some flexibility, but the top of a desk has very little or no flexibility. </advanced>
          <advanced>Absorbency is whether an object can soak up liquids; a tissue absorbs water, but plastic wrap does not.</advanced>
          <advanced>Buoyancy is whether an object floats; an ice cube floats in water, but a penny does not. </advanced>

          <simple>Bonds</simple>
          <advanced>All atoms would like to have a full outer shell, but the only elements to naturally have a full outer shell are the noble gases to the right of the periodic table. As a result, when atoms without full outer shells come into contact with other atoms, they tend to want to give up or gain electrons, this is called bonding</advanced>
          <advanced>The valence electrons are the number of electrons in an outer shell of an atom that can participate in forming chemical bonds with other atoms.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two general types of bonds that atoms can form: Ionic and covalent</advanced>
          <advanced>Ionic bonding occurs when one element donates an electron (or electrons) to another so that both elements will have a full outer shell.</advanced>
          <advanced>In covalent bonding electrons are shared between atoms rather than donated in order for the atoms of both elements to gain full outer shells. Electrons are always shared in pairs.</advanced>
          <advanced>After bonding, the atoms become more stable than before, and their energy levels become lower</advanced>
          <quiz>This happens between the valence (outer) shell of electrons of two or more atoms</quiz>
          <quiz>This is the process of sharing electrons</quiz>
          <quiz>Atoms form these to become more stable</quiz>

          <simple>Hydrogen</simple>
          <advanced>Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table. It is the simplest possible atom composed of one proton in the nucleus which is orbited by a single electron. Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements and is the most abundant element in the universe.</advanced>
          <advanced>At standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas.</advanced>
          <advanced>Hydrogen is very flammable and burns with an invisible flame. It burns when it comes into contact with oxygen. The byproduct of a hydrogen and oxygen explosion is water.</advanced>

          <advanced>Oxygen is a very reactive element that easily forms compounds such as oxides.</advanced>
          <advanced>Oxygen is essential to human life, it is found in the air we breathe and the water we drink (H20).</advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Compounds</simple>
          <advanced>A compound is a type of molecule with more than one element.</advanced>
          <advanced>Chemical compounds are formed when elements are joined by chemical bonds. These bonds are so strong that the compound behaves like a single substance. Compounds have their own properties that are unique from the elements they are made of. </advanced>
          <quiz>This is a type of molecule with one or more elements. </quiz>

          <advanced>The electron is a negatively charged particle that spins around the outside of the nucleus.</advanced>
          <advanced>Electrons spin so fast around the nucleus, scientists can never be 100% sure where they are located, therefore they are said to exist in shells</advanced>
          <advanced>Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons: the first layer can hold two electrons, the second layer eight electrons, the third layer eighteen electrons, etc.</advanced>
          <advanced> If there are the same number of electrons and protons in an atom, then the atom is said to have a neutral charge. </advanced>
          <advanced>Electrons have a mass of about 1/2000 of a proton, therefore, we say that they do not affect the mass of the atom, however, they're charge is equally strong as that of a proton</advanced>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Temperature</simple>
          <advanced>Heat and temperature are two words that we use interchangeably every day, but they mean very different things in science!</advanced>
          <advanced>Before we take a look at what temperature means, we need to know what matter is</advanced>
          <advanced>Matter is anything that occupies space. All matter is made up of particles. </advanced>
          <advanced>The temperature of something depends on how fast its particles are moving. In other words, temperature is related to the kinetic energy (the energy of movement) of the particles of matter.  </advanced>
          <advanced> Matter that has faster-moving particles (higher kinetic energy) has a higher temperature than matter that has slower-moving particles (lower kinetic energy). </advanced>
          <advanced>temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The unit for temperature is the degree Celsius.</advanced>
          <advanced>We say “average” kinetic energy because using the average kinetic energy gives a better indication of the energy of the particles. Some particles have more energy, and other have less.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Heat</simple>
          <advanced>The amount of heat in an object depends on its temperature, mass, and composition. </advanced>
          <advanced>Heat is a form of energy. Therefore, heat is related to other forms of energy, such as sound energy, electrical energy, nuclear energy etc.</advanced>
          <advanced>All these types of energy have one thing in common: energy can cause matter to change.</advanced>
          <advanced>Heat (or heat energy), is the energy that is transferred from matter at a higher temperature to matter at a lower temperature.</advanced>
          <advanced>The SI unit for heat energy is the joule. </advanced>
          <advanced>Thermometers demonstrate the ability of heat to change matter. Adding heat energy to matter generally causes matter to expand—the volume increases. Removing heat energy from matter generally causes matter to contract—the volume decreases.</advanced>
          <advanced>Now that we understand heat, lets take a look at the particle theory of matter</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Particle theory of matter</simple>
          <advanced>The following are the main ideas of the particle theory of matter:</advanced>
          <advanced>All matter is made up of extremely tiny particles, which are attracted or bonded to each other.</advanced>
          <advanced>The particles of matter are always moving and vibrating. This movement involves kinetic energy.</advanced>
          <advanced>Adding heat energy to matter makes the particles move around faster and vibrate faster.</advanced>
          <advanced>Faster-moving things have more kinetic energy. So adding heat energy increases the kinetic energy of the particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>The particles also have space between them. This is empty space not filled with air. Different states of matter have different amounts of space between the particles.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Insulators and conductors</simple>
          <advanced>Different materials respond to heat in different ways. There are two general types of materials, conductors and insulators. Let's take a look at each one.</advanced>
          <advanced>A substance that lets heat energy move through it easily is a conductor. Conductors can also carry electricity (electrical energy).</advanced>
          <advanced>A material that is not a good conductor—that is, it does not allow heat energy to move through it easily—is called an insulator.</advanced>
          <advanced>For example, plastic, glass, and wood are good insulators, or poor conductors.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Transferring heat</simple>
          <advanced>Heat can move and be transferred between particles in three different ways: radiation, conduction and convection. Let's take a look at each one!</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Radiation</simple>
          <advanced>Radiation is the transfer of heat energy (as well as other kinds of energy) in the form of radiant energy waves.</advanced>
          <advanced>For example, The Sun sends out (radiates) tremendous amounts of energy in the form of waves. These energy waves include infrared waves, which are waves of heat energy.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Conduction</simple>
          <advanced>conduction, which is the transfer of heat energy between substances that are in contact. </advanced>
          <advanced>For example, if you put your spoon in a hot bowl of soup, then you will notice the end of the spoon gets hot too, even thought it never touched the soup. This is conduction</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Convection</simple>
          <advanced>Convection is the transfer of heat energy that happens when heated gas or liquid particles move from one location to another.</advanced>
          <advanced>When heat energy is transferred by convection, it often moves in a circular pattern called a convection current.</advanced>
          <advanced>Convection currents can form when heat energy is added to gases and liquids </advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Types of change</simple>
          <advanced>Finally, let's look at the different types of change</advanced>
          <advanced>Above, the kinetic particle theory talked about matter changing states, this type of change is known as a reversible change.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two general types of change, reversible and irreversible</advanced>
          <advanced>Reversible means you can change a substance back to the way it was before the change of state happened. It can also mean that its characteristics do not change.</advanced>
          <advanced> If you melt ice into water, you can refreeze the water to turn it back into ice. If you cut a piece of paper in half, you have not changed its properties. </advanced>
          <advanced> Other changes of state are non-reversible. Non-reversible means that a new product is formed after the substance goes through a change of state. If you burned the paper, would you be able to change it back into paper again?</advanced>
          <advanced>Reversible changes are often called physical change. Irreversible changes are called chemical changes</advanced>

          <simple>Kinetic particle theory</simple>
          <advanced>The kinetic particle theory explains the properties of the different states of matter. </advanced>
          <advanced>The particles in solids, liquids and gases have different amounts of energy. They are arranged differently and move in different ways.</advanced>
          <quiz>This states that different states have different amounts of energy, and this causes them to behave and move differently</quiz>
          <quiz>This theory explains the properties of the different states of matter</quiz>
        </model>

        <model section="2">
          <simple>Solid</simple>
          <advanced> A solid has a definite shape and volume. The shape of solid matter does not depend on the shape of the container holding it. Your desk is a solid.</advanced>
          <advanced>In a solid, the particles are close together, and do not move. They form a regular pattern, and vibrate in one location</advanced>
          <advanced>Solids can become either liquids, in a process called melting, or gasses, in a process called sublimation</advanced>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles close together, and is unable to change shape</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles vibrating in only one location</quiz>
          <quiz>Particles in this state cannot flow</quiz>
        </model><model section="2">
          <simple>Liquid</simple>
          <advanced>A liquid flows, has a fixed volume, and takes the shape of its container. Ketchup, melted wax, and concrete that has not set are liquids. </advanced>
          <advanced>In a liquid the particles are close together, in a random arrangement and can move around each other</advanced>
          <advanced>Liquids can become solids in a process called freezing, or a gas in a process called boiling</advanced>
          <advanced>Boiling is not to be confused with evaporation, they are different in the following ways: evaporation can occur at any temperature - not just the boiling point </advanced>
          <advanced>it only happens at the surface of the liquid - not throughout like boiling, and finally boiling requires energy, whereas evaporation is the release of the highest energy particles</advanced>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles close together, however, they are able to change shape</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter can both freeze, boil and evaporate</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter takes the shape of the container it is in, and is unable to be compressed</quiz>
        </model><model section="1">
          <simple>Brownian motion</simple>
          <advanced>Particles in both liquids and gases (collectively called fluids) move randomly. This is called Brownian motion. They do this because they are bombarded by the other moving particles in the fluid. Larger particles can be moved by light, fast-moving molecules.</advanced>
          <advanced>Brownian motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who first observed this in 1827. He used a microscope to look at pollen grains moving randomly in water. At this point, he could not explain why this occurred.</advanced>
          <advanced>But in 1905, physicist Albert Einstein explained that the pollen grains were being moved by individual water molecules. This confirmed that atoms and molecules did exist, and provided evidence for particle theory.</advanced>
          <quiz>This states that particles move randomly</quiz>
          <quiz>This theory helped prove that atoms and molecules exist, and provided evidence for the particle theory</quiz>
        </model><model section="2">
          <simple>Gas</simple>
          <advanced>A gas takes the shape and volume of its container. Smoke and steam are gases.</advanced>
          <advanced>In a gas the particles are far apart, in a random arrangement, and they move quickly in all directions</advanced>
          <advanced>Gasses flow and completely fill their container, this is because the particles can quickly move in all directions, and try to spread out as much as possible</advanced>
          <advanced>Gasses can be squished and compressed, this is because there is space between the particles themselves</advanced>
          <quiz>In this state of matter, the particles are far apart and move quickly</quiz>
          <quiz>In this state of matter particles can be compressed</quiz>
        </model><model section="1">
          <simple>Thermal expansion</simple>
          <advanced>All three states of matter (solid, liquid and gas) expand when heated. The atoms themselves do not expand, but the volume they take up does.</advanced>
          <advanced>When a solid is heated, its atoms vibrate faster about their fixed points. The relative increase in the size of solids when heated is therefore small. </advanced>
          <advanced>Liquids expand for the same reason, but because the bonds between separate molecules are usually less tight they expand more than solids. </advanced>
          <advanced>Molecules within gases are further apart and weakly attracted to each other. Heat causes the molecules to move faster, (heat energy is converted to kinetic energy) which means that the volume of a gas increases more than the volume of a solid or liquid.</advanced>
          <quiz>This states that all states of matter expand when heated</quiz>

          <simple>Specific latent heat</simple>
          <advanced>The specific latent heat of a substance is a measure of how much heat energy is needed to melt or boil it. It is the energy needed to melt or boil 1 kg of the substance.</advanced>
          <advanced>Different substances have different specific latent heats. The specific latent heat of a given substance is different for boiling than it is for melting.</advanced>
          <advanced>For example the specific latent heat of water is 334 kJ/kg for melting, while for boiling it is 2260 kJ/kg. (kJ means kilo joules, which is the same as 1000 Joules. Joules is a unit of energy) </advanced>
          <advanced>Here is the equation that relates energy to specific latent heat: energy (J) = mass (kg) × specific latent heat (J/kg)</advanced>
          <advanced>The latent heat of melting is sometimes called the latent heat of fusion, while the latent heat of boiling is sometimes called the latent heat of vaporization. </advanced>

          <advanced>In a homogeneous mixture all the substances are evenly distributed throughout the mixture (salt water, air, blood).</advanced>
          <advanced>In a heterogeneous mixture the substances are not evenly distributed (chocolate chip cookies, pizza, rocks)</advanced>
          <advanced>Within the categories of homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures there are more specific types of mixtures including solutions, alloys, suspensions, and colloids.</advanced>

          <simple>Solutions</simple>
          <advanced>A solution is a mixture where one of the substances dissolves in the other. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that does not dissolve is called the solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced> The amount of a solvent that we can dissovle is determined by the solubility. If you started to add sugar to water, you would notice that after a certain amount, it would stop dissolving, this amount is called the solubility</advanced>
          <advanced>Not all solutes and solvents form solutions. For example, if you added sand to water, it would not dissolve</advanced>
          <advanced>Some solutes “fit” with the solvent and dissolve. For example, sugar dissolves in water because the sugar particles bind (combine) with the water particles. Some solute particles do not bind with the solvent particles. Solutes that do not bind well are called insoluble solutes.</advanced>
          <advanced>Sometimes, it's possible to dissolve more of a solvant than normal, these solutions are called "super-saturated"</advanced>
          <advanced>Once a solution is formed, there are ways to seperate solutions. these include filtration, distallation and decanting let's take a look at these below</advanced>
          <advanced>Filtration is a common technique used to separate solids from liquids. A common example used in many household kitchens is making coffee. The coffee grounds are in a coffee filter. Water drips onto the coffee grounds, absorbs the soluble coffee, and drips through the filter. The insoluble grounds are left behind because they cannot pass through the filter.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some solutions are made up of more than one solvent. In these solutions, a process called distillation can be used to separate a solid from a liquid or one liquid in a mixture from another. </advanced>
          <advanced>Decanting is a technique used to separate a liquid from a denser solid or liquid that is insoluble in water.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is a type of mixture where one substance dissolves the other</quiz>
          <quiz>It consists of two parts, the solute and the solvent</quiz>
          <quiz>Salt water is this type of mixture</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Alloys</simple>
          <advanced>An alloy is a mixture of elements that has the characteristic of a metal. At least one of the elements mixed is a metal. One example of an alloy is steel which is made from a mixture of iron and carbon.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is a mixture of elements that have the characteristics of a metal</quiz>
          <quiz>At least one of the elements in these mixtures is a metal</quiz>
          <quiz>Steel is an example of this alloy</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Bronze</simple>
          <advanced>Bronze is a metal alloy. Bronze is mostly copper, with some tin added (usually between 5% and 20% tin).</advanced>
          <advanced>Bronze was the first alloy that was used by humans. The first nation that used Bronze was Egypt about 3500 years B.C. This gave the name for the Bronze Age.</advanced>
          <advanced>Bronze is stronger than copper or tin alone. Bronze lasts longer than copper. Pure copper can be oxidized by air and also by water. When copper is oxidized by air or water, it turns green (the color of "copper oxide"), and falls apart.</advanced>
          <quiz>This was the first alloy used by humans</quiz>
          <quiz>This alloy is made of copper and tin</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Steal</simple>
          <advanced>Steel is a mixture of several metals but most of it is iron. Steel is harder and stronger than iron. Steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02% and 1.7% percent carbon by weight. </advanced>
          <advanced>Steel has a long history. People in India and Sri Lanka were making small amounts of steel more than 2,500 years ago. It was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives.</advanced>
          <advanced> It is a very cheap metal and is used to make many things. Steel is used in making buildings and bridges, and all kinds of machines. Almost all ships and cars are today made from steel. When a steel object is old, or it is broken beyond repair, it is called scrap. It can be melted down and re-shaped into a new object. Steel is recyclable material; that is, the same steel can be used and re-used.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is one of the most common alloys in use today, and is used in machines, building, and cars among other things</quiz>
          <quiz>This alloy is made of iron and carbon</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Solder</simple>
          <advanced>Solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature. Here are two types of solder; soft solder and hard solder. Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work. Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two main types of soft solder; lead solder and lead-free solder. Lead solders have about 60% (or 63%) tin and 40% (or 37%) lead in them. Today lead solder is banned in many applications, because of its toxic effects</advanced>
          <quiz>This alloy melts at very low temperatures</quiz>
          <quiz>This alloy is made of tin and lead</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Suspensions</simple>
          <advanced>A suspension is a mixture between a liquid and particles of a solid. In this case the particles do not dissolve. The particles and the liquid are mixed up so that the particles are dispersed throughout the liquid. They are "suspended" in the liquid. A key characteristic of a suspension is that the solid particles will settle and separate over time if left alone.</advanced>
          <advanced>An example of a suspension is a mixture of water and sand. When mixed up, the sand will disperse throughout the water. If left alone, the sand will settle to the bottom.</advanced>
          <quiz>If I mix water and sand, it becomes this kind of mixture</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Colloids</simple>
          <advanced>A colloid is a mixture where very small particles of one substance are evenly distributed throughout another substance. They appear very similar to solutions, but the particles are suspended in the solution rather than fully dissolved.</advanced>
          <advanced>The difference between a colloid and a suspension is that the particles will not settle to the bottom over a period of time, they will stay suspended or float.</advanced>
          <quiz>This type of mixtures is similar to suspensions, but the particles do not settle over time</quiz>
          <quiz>This type of mixture has particles suspended and spread out in the solution</quiz>
        </model><model>
          <simple>Concentration</simple>
          <advanced>In chemistry, concentration is how much of a substance is mixed with another substance. In other words, it has many solute particles compared with the number of solvent particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>The substance that is dissolved (shown as the red dye in the example) is known as the solute. The substance in which the solute is dissolved (shown as the water in the example) is known as the solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced>To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute, or reduce the amount of solvent. To dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute.</advanced>
          <advanced>A dilute solution has small amounts of solute in a solvent, or has only a few solute particles compared with the number of solvent particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>Concentrated and dilute are relative terms. They tell you whether there are small or large amounts of solute in the solvent. But they do not tell you exactly how much solute is in a certain amount of solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced>The concentration of a solution tells you the amount of solute (in grams) dissolved in a certain amount of solution.</advanced>
          <advanced>For example, a solution with 50 g of solute dissolved in 100 mL of water is said to have a concentration of 50 g/100 mL of solution. This is read as “fifty grams per one hundred milliliters.”</advanced>
          <quiz>This describes the amount of a substance (the solute) that is dissolved in another substance (the solvent)</quiz>
          <quiz>This describes how dilute, or how concentrated a solution is</quiz>

          <simple>Classification</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about the history of taxonomy, and how we classify all living things</advanced>
          <advanced>Back in the 18th century, a Swedish man named Carolus Linnaeus thought it was important to organize living things, and he developed a system to do just that. </advanced>
          <advanced>His system first only contained plants, however, he quickly expanded it to include all living organisms. We still use the essence of his system today. Scientists are constantly refining the system based on new knowledge. </advanced>
          <advanced>Putting animals in order like this is called taxonomy. The taxonomists — people who name animals — use a book called the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, or ICZN, to tell them the rules for classifying animals.</advanced>
        </model>
        <model section="1">
          <simple>Linnaeus’s system</simple>
          <advanced> His system has seven levels: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species</advanced>
          <advanced>Every animal on the planet, down to the most microscopic creature you can imagine, can be classified according to this system.</advanced>
          <advanced>An easy way to remember the order is to use the mnemonic: King Phillip, come out, for goodness’ sake!</advanced>
          <advanced>To use this module, simply click on the names of the levels, and look at some animals in those levels, try and see how they are related!</advanced>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Kingdom</simple>
          <advanced>Generally, scientists agree there are six kingdoms. The animal kingdom (called Kingdom Animalia) is just one of those. </advanced>
          <advanced>The others are Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, Protists, Fungi and Plants.</advanced>
          <advanced>Originally, Linnaeus only identified two kingdoms: plant and animal. Some scientists think that viruses should have their own kingdom, but currently they are not included under this system.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some animals found in the Animal kingdom are shown below</advanced>
          <quiz>There are six of these</quiz>
          <quiz>This is the first level of Linnaeus's system</quiz>
          <quiz>Archaebacteria, protists, Fungi and Plants are all examples of this level</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Phylum</simple>
          <advanced>Within the animal kingdom, the animals are divided into more than 30 phyla (which is the plural of “phylum”). </advanced>
          <advanced>Some better known phyla are Phylum Chordata and Phylum Arthropoda. Phylum Chordata is the one humans and all animals with backbones are in.</advanced>
          <advanced>Phylum Arthropoda contains insects, spiders and other animals with segmented bodies, like shrimp.  Arthropods have their skeletons on the outside of their bodies (think of the hard shell of a lobster) and other characteristics in common. </advanced>
          <advanced>Some animals in the Phylum Chordata are shown below</advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Order</simple>
          <advanced>The next level, or rank, is order. Orders are smaller groups within the different classes.</advanced>
          <advanced>Different orders include Lepidoptera and Carnivora. Lepidoptera is the order of moths and butterflies. Carnivora is the order within Mammalia that has the most diversity in animal size.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some animals in the Carnivora order are shown below</advanced>

          <advanced>If animals can breed together successfully, they are a species. When an animal is called by its scientific name, then that means it is being identified by its genus and species. </advanced>
          <advanced> We use a lowercase letter and italics for the species. </advanced>
          <advanced>For example, the scientific name of dogs is Canis familiaris; however, the scientific name of wolves is Canis lupus.</advanced>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Energy Sources</simple>
          <advanced>Electricity is sometimes called electric power (or “power” for short) and electricity generating facilities are also called power stations.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two types of energy sources, renewable and non-renewable. As we begin to need and depend more on energy, it is more important than ever to understand each of the different sources. As well as their pros and cons. </advanced>
          <advanced> A renewable energy resource can be used over and over. It is never used up. </advanced>
          <advanced> energy resource can only be used once. This is because most non-renewable energy resources are fossil fuels made from the organic remains of plants and animals. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form and therefore cannot be quickly replaced. </advanced>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Nuclear power</simple>
          <advanced>Nuclear power is the controlled use of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is energy in uranium that can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor. This energy is made into electricity, which then can be used to power machines and heat homes.</advanced>
          <advanced>14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power. Nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly. Nuclеar power plants produce less radioactive material than a coal-fired power station</advanced>
          <advanced>Nuclear power plants operate on a process known as fission, which takes a larger molecule and breaks it into smaller pieces, releasing energy in the process</advanced>
          <advanced>The sun uses a process known as nuclear fusion, which joins two smaller molecules together to form a larger one, releasing a huge amount of heat. Researchers hope to use this form of energy in the future, as it is safer, more efficient, and greener than any current technology</advanced>

          <advanced>There are several things to consider nuclear energy. Nuclear power plants are expensive to build and maintain. </advanced>
          <advanced> A nuclear power plant functions for 30 to 50 years before it must be decommissioned. The waste is highly radioactive and must be carefully handled and stored for a long period of time. Chances of a nuclear accident must be minimized. </advanced>

          <quiz>It generates energy from radioactive materials</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source operates on a process known as nuclear fission</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source has caused many disasters, such as Chernobyl, or Three Mile Island</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Hydro power</simple>

          <advanced>Hydroelectricity is electricity generated by the force of water. Hydroelectric generating stations create electricity by having a flow of water turn a generator. </advanced>
          <advanced>A spinning generator changes the energy of its motion into electrical energy.</advanced>
          <advanced>Water needed to spin the generator usually comes from a river that has been blocked by a dam. The blocked water forms a reservoir that can be used for both recreational activities and farm irrigation.</advanced>
          <advanced>With a dam, there will always be water available to turn the generators and make electricity.</advanced>
          <advanced>Dams are expensive to build and so are the long transmission lines that carry electricity from the dams to businesses and homes.</advanced>
          <advanced> However, hydroelectric power generators run without creating pollution, and they are reasonably cheap to operate. </advanced>
          <advanced> Unlike other energy resources, hydroelectric power generators can be started and stopped in a matter of minutes. This makes them more flexible to use during high demand times.</advanced>
          <advanced> There are only a limited number of places where hydroelectric dams can be built because of impacts on the environment and local communities. When a dam and reservoir are created, flooding of the surrounding land affects the habitat of all plant and animal life in the area. </advanced>

          <quiz>This form of power uses the flowing of water to generate electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source can cause flooding in some areas, and can damage the ecosystem</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Oil and Coal power</simple>
          <advanced>Almost half of the world’s electricity comes from burning coal. </advanced>
          <advanced>Coal is burned to heat water into steam, which is then used to spin generators to create electricity. The process is similar to the generators in dams, except that in dams water is used instead of steam. </advanced>
          <advanced> Using coal for making electricity is relatively cheap, and the world has a large quantity of coal available. An added benefit of using coal is that other products can be made from it. These products include fertilizers, paints, and plastics.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, using coal has disadvantages. Mining coal can be dangerous and disruptive to the environment, so mining companies are required to try to restore the land to its original form when they have completed the mining process.</advanced>
          <advanced>Burning coal can create air and water pollution and is often considered one of the “dirtiest” forms of energy generation. As coal is non-renewable, it will eventually be used up, or be too expensive to mine.</advanced>

          <quiz>This is our main form of generating electricity currently, however it is harmful to the environment</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source uses organic material that is millions of years old</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Wind power</simple>
          <advanced>Wind energy is the energy from the bulk movement of air. Wind is caused by pressure differences in the atmosphere which are caused by uneven heating of the earth by the sun. </advanced>
          <advanced>Air moves from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, which produces wind as a result.</advanced>
          <advanced> Wind power is the fastest growing renewable energy source. It is also the most widely available renewable energy source in the world.</advanced>

          <advanced>Collecting energy from the wind requires a windmill, turbine, or blade to catch and turn in the wind. There are many types of devices that can be used but the multi blade and two- or three-blade high-speed rotors are the most common. </advanced>
          <advanced>Wind is free, renewable, and emission free, and  windmills can be set up faster than dams or coal power plants.</advanced>
          <advanced> Unfortunately, wind speed is variable, turbines break down, birds can be killed flying into them, and the electricity is expensive to generate. Also, a large area  of land is needed for “wind farms.” </advanced>
          <advanced> the long-term effects of wind farms on the land are not known. There is the possibility of noise pollution from the sound of the blades for those living close by.</advanced>

          <quiz>This is the fastest growing renewable energy source</quiz>
          <quiz>This energy source uses the movement of air to create electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This energy source can be over 100 meters tall</quiz>

          <simple>Solar power</simple>
          <advanced>Solar energy is the energy that is in sunlight. Solar power plants convert sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).</advanced>
          <advanced>concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.</advanced>

          <advanced>The collection and use of the free heat energy from the Sun for household heating is called passive solar heating.</advanced>
          <advanced>When solar energy is used in conjunction with other electrical devices, it is called active solar heating.</advanced>
          <advanced>Solar energy is simple to use. It can be added to houses quite easily. There is generally no visible pollution when solar energy is used to generate electricity.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, using solar energy to generate electricity does have some problems. The Sun only shines for part of the day, and some days may be cloudy.</advanced>
          <advanced>A solar cell used to generate electricity is quite expensive.  Generating electricity from solar energy also takes up a lot of space. Many generating projects using solar energy are small-scale because it would take a large area of land to produce a vast amount of electricity.</advanced>

          <quiz>This form of energy uses the technology of photovoltaics, or concentrated solar power, to generate electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This form of energy can only produce electricity during the day</quiz>

          <simple>Biomass</simple>
          <advanced>Biomass is any plant or animal material that can be safely burned and makes a good fuel. Most organic material, trees and shrubs, and most agricultural material, for example, grains or crops, can be used as biomass. Even animal manure is used. </advanced>
          <advanced> Biomass energy generation reuses organic material to produce energy. Biomass is burned to create steam in electricity generators similar to those fuelled by wind and geothermal energy. </advanced>
          <advanced> Reusing these wastes has great potential not only as an efficient energy source, but also as a positive impact on the environment. Landfills and waste centers could be used less, and the supply of waste never runs out! </advanced>
          <advanced> The supply of biomass would be cheap, but the cost of building a new generation unit is very expensive. Also, people need to be careful about what is used as biomass. Some waste products, like plastic, should not be burned.</advanced>
          <advanced>Because biomass use is relatively new, there are not many rules on how much, or what, should be burned. Many people are concerned that if burning biomass is not properly regulated, companies might start burning materials that are not considered “waste.” </advanced>

          <quiz>This is the use of animal or plant remains for energy</quiz>
          <quiz>This is a relatively new form of energy, and there are not many rules, which could lead to enviornmental problems</quiz>

        <simple>Fossils</simple>
        <advanced>In this module you will learn about fossils, how they are formed, how they are found, and why they are important</advanced>
        <advanced>Fossils can be the shells, bones, or teeth of animals. They can be the leaves, pollen, or woody stems of plants. Fossils can even be the bones or teeth of ancient people. </advanced>
        <advanced> In other words, a fossil is the remains, imprint, or trace of a plant or animal that lived long ago. </advanced>
        <advanced> Fossils are found in sedimentary rock, such as limestone, sandstone, or shale. </advanced>

        <advanced>Their observations can sometimes tell scientists what might have happened on Earth during the time that the fossilized plant or animal lived. </advanced>
        <advanced>fossils help scientists understand the events of the past, how organisms looked, and how they lived.</advanced>
        <advanced>By studying fossils we can determine what an organism looked like. Fossils can also tell us about the gradual changes and adaptations that a species underwent. </advanced>
        <advanced>By examining a collection of fossils in an area, scientists may be able to explain why certain animals became extinct.</advanced>

          <simple>Flight</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about how flying works, and the different ways we fly today</advanced>
          <advanced>Before we learn about flight, lets review a little about forces</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Forces</simple>
          <advanced>For scientists, a force causes an object’s motion to change. It can be a push or a pull. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Gravity and Lift</simple>
          <advanced> Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects that have mass. For example, you are pulled toward Earth, and Earth is pulled toward you. </advanced>
          <advanced>Scientists call this pull gravity. They have found that the more mass an object has, the greater the force of gravity between Earth and that object </advanced>

          <advanced>Living things that fly must experience a force that goes against gravity. Scientists call such a force lift. </advanced>
          <advanced>For something to fly there must be enough lift to overcome the force of gravity. Naturally, birds require less lift to fly than airplanes. The lighter the object, the less lift required. </advanced>

          <quiz>This is the force that goes against gravity</quiz>
          <quiz>In order to fly, this force must be equal to or greater than gravity</quiz>

          <quiz>this is the force of attraction between two objects that have mass</quiz>
          <quiz>All objects must overcome this force in order to fly</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Thrust and Drag</simple>
          <advanced>Thrust is the scientific name of the force that pushes any animal or object forward. Birds and insects get their thrust and lift from flapping their wings. </advanced>

          <advanced>Drag is the scientific name of a force that slows you down. Drag resists motion. As birds and insects move through the air, the air pushes against their movement, creating drag. </advanced>

          <quiz>This is a force that slows you down</quiz>
          <quiz>This force is caused by air pushing against the movement of an object</quiz>

          <quiz>This forces pushes an object or animal forward</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Internal combustion engines</simple>
          <advanced>Early airplanes used an internal combustion engine, an engine in which the fuel is burned within the engine itself. This engine powered the propeller, which provided thrust. </advanced>
          <quiz>This was used in early airplanes</quiz>
          <quiz>This is what powered the propeller in early airplanes</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Jet Engines</simple>
          <advanced>Henri Coanda’s first jet engine created thrust differently. Jet engines work by igniting fuel and compressed oxygen inside the engine.</advanced>
          <advanced>This causes a large amount of exhaust gas to be released out of the rear of the aircraft, creating a large force. This force propels the aircraft forward.</advanced>
          <quiz>This engine was invented by Henri Coanda</quiz>
          <quiz>This engine ignites fuel and compressed oxygen</quiz>

        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Rocket</simple>
          <advanced>Rocket engines have been used to create thrust in rockets, airplanes, and spacecraft. All rocket engines accelerate a fluid for this purpose. </advanced>
          <advanced>In a chemical rocket engine, a fuel is burned, creating exhaust gases. High pressures and temperatures help to push the exhaust gases through a narrow rocket nozzle. </advanced>
          <advanced>Earlier, you learned that if the width of a passageway is narrowed, a fluid will move through it more quickly. This causes the exhaust gases to accelerate as they pass through the rocket nozzle, and thrust is created. </advanced>
          <quiz>This engine uses a narrow nozzle to propel the exhaust gasses out, and create thrust</quiz>

          <advanced>Steel is a mixture of several metals (this is called an alloy) but most of it is iron.</advanced>
          <advanced>Something made of pure iron is softer than steel because the atoms can slip over one another. If other atoms like carbon are added, they are different from iron atoms and stop the iron atoms from sliding apart so easily. This makes the metal stronger and harder.</advanced>
          <advanced>Although steel is stronger and lighter than iron, it is often not strong or light enough for use in most rockets</advanced>

          <simple>Solid fuel</simple>
          <advanced>Solid rocket fuels are those in which the fuel and oxidizer compounds are already combined.</advanced>
          <advanced>Most use an aluminum powder as the fuel and an ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, while an iron powder is used as a catalyst for the reaction.</advanced>
          <advanced>Solid fuels are generally used more for the initial launch sequence, when the speed needs to be at its maximum, whereas liquid fuels are used later so the speed can be adjusted to get the rocket’s payload on to the right trajectory.</advanced>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Liquid fuel</simple>
          <advanced>Liquid propellants separate fuel and oxidizers and the two are combined in a combustion chamber where they burn and are ﬁred out from the base of the rocket.</advanced>
          <advanced>Liquid fuels are further subcategorized into either petroleum, cryogens or hypergols.</advanced>
          <advanced>Petroleum is fuel derived from crude oil and hydrocarbons, it consists of a highly refined kerosene mixed with liquid oxygen.</advanced>
          <advanced>Cryogens are those stored at very low temperatures (such as liquid hydrogen)</advanced>
          <advanced>Hypergols are able to self-ignite on contact between the fuel and the oxidizer.  These fuels simply needs nitric acid in order to ignite and are frequently used for propulsion when out in space.</advanced>

          <advanced>Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, although it is the weakest of these four forces, it is important to life on Earth and the structure of the universe.</advanced>
          <advanced>Everything that has matter generates gravity, from a grain of sand to the largest objects in the universe. The larger an object is, the stronger its force</advanced>
          <advanced>In order for a rocket to reach space, the force it exerts up, must be more than the force of gravity pulling it down</advanced>

          <advanced>In this module you will learn about simple machines, and forces. As well as some everyday examples where they are used!</advanced>
          <advanced>Simple machines help us apply force. Lifting a load, which is a weight to be carried or moved, is an example of applying force.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some simple machines create a mechanical advantage to help you use less force to lift a load. A mechanical advantage is when you apply less force to lift a load than you would without the simple machine. </advanced>
          <advanced>Simple machines can also change the direction in which a force needs to be applied, or the speed in which a load moves.</advanced>
          <advanced>Before we learn about simple machines, lets learn a little about forces</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Forces</simple>
          <advanced>In science, a force is a push or a pull that causes an object to start or stop moving, or changes the direction an object is moving.</advanced>
          <advanced> Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist who lived over 300 years ago. He discovered that forces occur in pairs, and they can be either balanced or unbalanced. </advanced>
          <advanced> How do we know if forces are balanced or unbalanced? When an object travels at a constant speed, Newton concluded that the forces acting on the object are balanced. </advanced>

          <simple>Rocks and Minerals</simple>
          <advanced>Geologists are scientists who study rocks. </advanced>
          <advanced>To a geologist, a rock and a mineral are two different things that occur in nature.</advanced>
          <advanced>Imagine two chocolate bars. One is pure chocolate, and the other has caramel and nuts in it. The pure chocolate bar is like a mineral. In science, a mineral is a solid that is made of the same substance throughout.</advanced>
          <advanced>The chocolate bar that contains nuts and caramel is like a rock. A rock is a solid that is made of two or more minerals. </advanced>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Minerals</simple>
          <advanced>All rocks are made of minerals. A mineral is a pure substance that forms naturally as a solid in Earth. </advanced>
          <advanced> Some rocks, such as limestone, are formed of only one mineral. Other rocks, such as granite, are made up of several minerals.</advanced>
          <advanced>Minerals are classified by their chemical composition (by what chemicals are in them).</advanced>
          <advanced>You may have heard the names of some of the most common minerals, such as quartz and mica. There are thousands of different minerals, and these can combine to form many kinds of rocks. </advanced>
          <advanced>you do not have to know thousands of minerals to be able to identify most of the rocks you will find. Just five minerals combine in different ways to form most of the rocks in Earth’s crust.</advanced>
          <advanced> These minerals are, calcite, quartz, feldspar, mica, hornblende</advanced>
          <advanced>Two rocks can have exactly the same minerals in them, but they may look different because they formed in different ways. The way the minerals are arranged and the sizes of the individual grains can all give clues to how a rock formed.</advanced>

          <simple>Sedimentary rock</simple>
          <advanced>rocks at or near Earth's surface are broken into smaller pieces by water, wind, and ice. Soil and shell pieces are also moved along with rock pieces. </advanced>
          <advacned>The pieces (called sediment) often settle in layers, such as in desert dunes and on the bottoms of  rivers, lakes, and oceans.</advacned>
          <advanced> Over millions of years, the layers are squeezed together. The weight and pressure of the layers above cause the sediment to become cemented together to form new rock.</advanced>
          <advanced>This is how igneous, metamorphic, and older sedimentary rocks are recycled to become newsedimentary rocks. </advanced>

          <advanced>Igneous rocks are formed from volcanic activity, under high heat and pressure</advanced>
          <advanced>Igneous rock covers the ocean floor, so two- thirds of Earth’s surface is igneous rock! In fact, all types of rocks on Earth began as igneous rock. </advanced>

          <model section="1">
            <simple>Weathering</simple>
            <advanced>Weathering is one of the reasons that rocks change. Weathering is the process that wears down rocks and other objects. </advanced>
            <advanced>Think back to the types of rock you studied earlier: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Even though most of Earth’s crust is made of igneous rocks, many of the rocks we see on the surface are sedimentary rocks.</advanced>
            <advanced>Most sedimentary rocks form from tiny rock fragments piling up and being pressed together. Where did the fragments come from? Weathering breaks rocks into tiny pieces, which helps to form sedimentary rocks and soil. </advanced>
            <advanced>there are many different types of weathering, lets take a look at them!</advanced>
          </model>
          <model>
            <simple>Mechanical weathering</simple>
            <advanced>Mechanical weathering happens when rock is broken apart by physical forces such as water or wind. In our climate, rock is often broken down by water freezing in cracks</advanced>
          </model>

          <model>
            <simple>Chemical weathering</simple>
            <advanced>Chemical weathering happens when water in the air combines with chemical substances in the air. Sometimes these substances are in the air naturally. Sometimes they are there because of cars, fires, and smoke from industry. </advanced>
            <advanced>combined with the rain or snow, the substances form solutions called acids. Rocks exposed to these acids gradually wear away.</advanced>

          <model>
            <simple>Biological weathering</simple>
            <advanced>Biological weathering is the wearing away of rocks by living things. Even small plants can “chip away” at rocks. </advanced>
          </model>

          <model>
            <simple>Erosion</simple>
            <advanced>Erosion is the movement of rock materials and soil by water, wind, or ice. These rock materials can be as big as boulders or as small as the grains in soil.</advanced>

          <model>
            <simple>Deposition</simple>
            <advanced> The settling of rock materials out of water, wind, or ice is called deposition. The material deposited is called sediment. These sediments form the sedimentary rock you learned about earlier in this unit. Sedimentary deposits usually form in layers.</advanced>

        </model>
        <model section="1">
          <simple>The Greenhouse effect</simple>
          <advanced>Greenhouse gases reflect radiation that the Earth emits, and stop it from being lost into space. This causes the Earth's temperature to be higher than it would be without greenhouse gases. The name for this is the "greenhouse effect."</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the effect that causes radiation to be reflected back to Earth</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="1">
          <simple>Greenhouse gasses</simple>
          <advanced>Most greenhouse gases are natural - water vapor is the most common, and causes most of the greenhouse effect on Earth. Other greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbon and ozone.</advanced>
          <advanced>Without greenhouse gases, the earth would be on average 33 degrees Celsius colder.</advanced>
          <quiz>These are gasses that cause the greenhouse effect</quiz>
          <quiz>Without these gasses the earth would be 33 degrees colder</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Water vapour</simple>
          <advanced>Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, both by weight and by volume </advanced>
          <advanced>Water vapour will generally stay in the atmosphere for days (before precipitating out) while other greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide or methane, will stay in the atmosphere for a much longer period of time (ranging from years to centuries) thus contributing to warming for an extended period of time.</advanced>
          <advanced>Increased water vapor content in the atmosphere is referred to as a feedback process. Warmer air is able to hold more moisture. As the climate warms, air temperatures rise, more evaporation from water sources and land occurs, thus increasing the atmospheric moisture content. </advanced>
          <advanced>The water vapour feedback process is most likely responsible for a doubling of the greenhouse effect when compared to the addition of carbon dioxide on its own </advanced>
          <quiz>This is the most abundant greenhouse gas</quiz>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas causes a feedback loop that doubles the greenhouse effect</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Carbon dioxide</simple>
          <advanced>Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring gas, that is released from decaying and living organisms, as well as volcanoes</advanced>
          <advanced>Carbon dioxide is also released when burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil, and it is the most important contributor to man-made greenhouse gasses</advanced>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is released by living and decaying organisms, as well as volcanoes</quiz>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is the most important contributor of man-made greenhouse gasses</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Methane</simple>
          <advanced>Methane is a normal gas released from wetlands, growing rise, raising cattle, using natural gas, and mining coal</advanced>
          <advanced>However, methane traps a lot of heat, and is considered the second most important contributor to man-made greenhouse gasses</advanced>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is released from wetlands, growing rice, and mining coal</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Nitrous oxide</simple>
          <advanced>Nitrous oxide is a natural part of the nitrogen cycle, and is released from bacteria in the soil and ocean</advanced>
          <advanced>However, it is also released by some factories, power plants, and fertilizers. This gas damages the protective ozone layer, and is extremely powerful </advanced>

          <advanced>The main factors affecting evaporation are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.</advanced>
          <advanced>The principal source of water vapour is the oceans, but evaporation also occurs in soils, snow, and ice.</advanced>

          <advanced> The Sun is on average 149 600 000 km, or one astronomical unit (1AU), away from Earth. It takes about 9 min for light to travel from the Sun to Earth.</advanced>
          <advanced>The Sun creates its energy mainly by combining hydrogen nuclei to produce helium nuclei, in a process called nuclear fusion. In this process, the Sun releases energy in the form of light, heat, and radioactive material.</advanced>
          <advanced>At its core, the heat of the Sun is estimated to be over 15 000 000 °C. </advanced>
          <advanced>The Sun is a medium-sized star, called a yellow dwarf</advanced>

          <advanced>It has the greatest range of temperature, from as hot as 370 °C to as cold as –150 °C. How hot or cold it can be depends on which side is facing the Sun.</advanced>
          <advanced>It completes one full revolution around the sun in 88 days</advanced>
          <advanced>Mercury has no atmosphere</advanced>

          <simple>Venus</simple>
          <advanced>Venus has a thick atmosphere, of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid</advanced>
          <advanced> Not only does the cloud reflect light, it also traps heat on the planet, just like a greenhouse. The planet’s temperature can reach 484 °C — hot enough to melt lead. </advanced>
          <advanced>The “greenhouse effect” also affects the weather on the planet. Winds on Venus have been estimated to be 380 km/h. That’s faster than most tornadoes!  </advanced>
          <advanced>Earth and Venus are about the same size and mass. Both have an iron core surrounded by a rocky surface. This is why Venus and Earth are called “twin” planets. </advanced>
          <advanced> This rocky surface also has a number of impact craters and mountains, but a lot of the surface of Venus has been shaped by volcanic activity. </advanced>
          <advanced> We also know that Venus spins in the opposite direction to Earth. This means that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. </advanced>
          <quiz>It has clouds made of acid</quiz>

          <advanced>Earth's atmosphere is made up of about 80% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen</advanced>
          <advanced> 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by water. It is the only planet with oceans of warm water. The planet’s oceans help to keep Earth’s temperature fairly constant.</advanced>
          <advanced>The atmosphere also protects us from meteoroids. When a meteoroid, a fragment of space rock, enters Earth’s atmosphere, friction causes the meteoroid to burn up and be seen as the streak of bright light in a meteor.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some meteors and asteroids have hit Earth though. Scientists believe that Hudson Bay was created when an asteroid hit Earth millions of years ago. These impacts have helped to shape Earth’s surface, but the surface has also been created by volcanic and tectonic activity.</advanced>
          <advanced>Tectonic activity is the back-and-forth movement of “plates” that float on the top layer of Earth</advanced>

          <simple>Mars</simple>
          <advanced>temperatures range from –70 °C during its winter to 22 °C in the Martian summer. During the winter, ice caps which cover the south and north poles, increase after shrinking in the summer. These ice caps, however, are not made out of water. They are similar to dry ice.</advanced>
          <advanced>The atmosphere of Mars is thinner than that of Earth and gives less protection. The surface of Mars has been affected by the impact of meteorites, large fragments of space rock that may collide with planets.</advanced>
          <advanced>The surface of Mars is covered in a variety of rocks and an iron-rich clay soil. </advanced>
          <advanced>The planet gets its reddish appearance because the soil “rusts.” The surface is also covered with volcanoes, mountains, canals, and canyons. Some of these are the largest and deepest in the solar system.</advanced>

          <simple>Jupiter</simple>
          <advanced> Jupiter is the largest of all the planets. It is so large that all the other planets in our solar system could fit inside it. </advanced>
          <advanced>Jupiter has over 50 moons, some of which are as large as planets</advanced>
          <advanced>Because Jupiter rotates so quickly, its gases are stretched out into bands that go around the entire planet. The different colours of Jupiter are caused by the clouds that surround it. </advanced>
          <advanced>These clouds are made up of different materials and are at different heights. For example, the white bands are made of frozen ammonia, and the blue bands are made of water.</advanced>
          <advanced>These gas clouds help to create the weather on Jupiter as well. The most identifiable feature of Jupiter is its Great Red Spot. This red spot is actually a storm of clouds on the planet that has winds of over 320 km/h. It is just like a hurricane.</advanced>

          <advanced>One year on Saturn is over 10,759 Earth days</advanced>

          <advanced>Saturn is best known for its impressive system of rings that surround this faint greenish-coloured gas giant. These rings measure 260 000 km across, but are only 14 m in thickness. </advanced>
          <advanced>Sometimes the rings look solid because they are made up of space “snowballs.” Some of these snowballs are as big as a house! </advanced>
          <advanced> Astronomers believe that the rings of Saturn come from the breakup of natural satellites that once revolved around the planet. Many satellites still orbit Saturn.</advanced>
          <advanced>Just like its neighbors, Saturn does not have a solid surface and it also has different-coloured spots. However, Saturn differs greatly from Jupiter. It is much lighter, or less dense.</advanced>
          <advanced> Since it is so light, and it rotates so quickly, Saturn’s shape is like a squished balloon. It oblates, or spreads out, along its equator. Much information on Saturn has been gained from space probes. The international Cassini mission has transmitted more than 140 000 images since 2004.</advanced>

          <advanced>Uranus has been tipped on its side, most likely by another planet</advanced>
          <advanced>Uranus has 27 moons named after characters from William Shakespeare</advanced>

          <advanced>The third of the Gas Giants, Uranus is often called an “Ice Gas Giant” because its atmosphere is made up of different types of ices. One of the chemicals is methane. It is the methane gas that gives Uranus its blue-green colour. </advanced>
          <advanced> Its rings, which are a characteristic of all the Gas Giants, are very difficult to see. They were not discovered until 1977, and even the Hubble Space Telescope often has trouble seeing the 11 dark rings. </advanced>\
          <advanced> Uranus is the only planet in our solar system to spin on its side, and, just like the planet Venus, it has retrograde motion. </advanced>
          <advanced>Astronomers believe that Uranus is on its side because it collided with a large object early in its history. Since Uranus is tilted so much, its north and south poles experience 42 years of light and 42 years of darkness. As well, each season lasts 21 years! </advanced>

          <advanced>Remember how the Gas Giants create their own heat? Neptune is about 4.3 billion km from the Sun so any energy it gets from the Sun is much less than what we get on Earth. From this distance, the Sun looks like just another bright light in Neptune’s sky. </advanced>
          <advanced>The heat that Neptune produces creates hurricane-like storms on its frozen seas. These storms look like large, dark ovals on its surface. </advanced>

          <advanced>Water is the common name for dihydrogen monoxide or H2O. </advanced>
          <advanced>In theory, it's easy to make water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Mix the two gases together, add a spark or sufficient heat to provide the activation energy to start the reaction, and presto—instant water.</advanced>
          <advanced>Merely mixing the two gases at room temperature, however, won't do anything, energy must be supplied to break the covalent bonds that hold H2 and O2 molecules together.</advanced>
          <advanced>When the chemical bonds re-form to make water, additional energy is released, which propagates the reaction. The net reaction is highly exothermic, meaning a reaction that is accompanied by the release of heat.</advanced>

          <advanced>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other things make food. It is a chemical process that uses sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into sugars the cell can use as energy.</advanced>
          <advanced>Light energy from the sun is used to split water molecules (photolysis). The sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant, causing an enzyme to break apart the water. Water, when broken, makes oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons.</advanced>
          <advanced>Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH</advanced>

        <simple>Waves</simple>
        <advanced>In this module you will learn about basic wave terminology</advanced>
        <advanced>There are lots of waves all around us in everyday life. Sound is a type of wave that moves through matter and then vibrates our eardrums, so we can hear. Light is a special kind of wave that is made up of photons. You can drop a rock into a pond and see waves form in the water. We even use waves (microwaves) to cook our food </advanced>
        <advanced>Waves can be divided into various categories depending on their characteristics. All waves can be categorized as either mechanical or electromagnetic.</advanced>
      </model>
      <model section="1">
        <simple>Mechanical waves</simple>
        <advanced>Mechanical waves are waves that require a medium. This means that they have to have some sort of matter to travel through. These waves travel when molecules in the medium collide with each other passing on energy.</advanced>
        <advanced>One example of a mechanical wave is sound. Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves travelling through a spring.</advanced>

      <model section="1">
        <simple>Transverse waves</simple>
        <advanced>Transverse waves are waves where the disturbance moves perpendicular to the direction of the wave.</advanced>
        <advanced>You can think of the wave moving left to right, while the disturbance moves up and down. One example of a transverse wave is a water wave where the water moves up and down as the wave passes through the ocean.</advanced>
        <quiz>This type of wave causes disturbances perpendicular to the direction of the wave</quiz>
        <quiz>Water waves move in this type of way</quiz>
      </model>
      <model section="1">
        <simple>Longitudinal waves</simple>
        <advanced>Longitudinal waves are waves where the disturbance moves in the same direction as the wave.</advanced>
        <advanced>One example of this is a wave moving through a stretched out slinky or spring. If you compress one portion of the slinky and let go, the wave will move left to right. At the same time, the disturbance (which is the coils of the springs moving), will also move left to right.</advanced>
        <advanced> Another classic example of a longitudinal wave is sound. As sound waves propagate through a medium, the molecules collide with each other in the same direction as the sound is moving.</advanced>

          <simple>Cellular respiration</simple>
          <advanced>Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a form that the cell can use as energy. </advanced>
          <advanced>Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses for energy. Usually, this process uses oxygen, and is called aerobic respiration.</advanced>
          <advanced>It also produces carbon dioxide as a waste product, which then enters the circulatory system. The carbon dioxide is taken to the lungs, where it is exchanged for oxygen.</advanced>
          <advanced>The equation for this process is Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP)</advanced>                  
          <advanced>But how do the chemical enter the cell? Let's take a look</advanced>             
          <advanced>The process in which particles enter the cell is called diffusion. Diffusion means particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration. This happens naturally, however, the cells membrane can also control what enters and leaves the cell</advanced>
          <advanced>So, the cell membrane allows the particles of some substances to pass through it, but not others. Scientists say that the cell membrane is selectively permeable. </advanced>        
          <advanced> One substance that can pass through the cell membrane is oxygen.</advanced>
          <advanced>>This movement of oxygen happens by diffusion, and it happens naturally.  Because the concentration of oxygen is usually higher outside the cell membrane than it is inside. As a result, oxygen simply diffuses into the cell. The cell does not have to do anything.</advanced>
          <advanced>The diffusion of water is vital to the survival and health of cells. For this reason, scientists give it a special name: osmosis</advanced>

          <advanced>The crust is the thinnest layer of our planet. Its average thickness is about 30 km under the continents, but it is only about 5–10 km thick under the oceans. Under big mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains, the crust can be up to 90 km thick. </advanced>
          <advanced>The total distance from the surface of the crust to Earth’s centre is about 6400 km. </advanced>
          <advanced> The soil, plants, and even the oceans that we see on the surface form only a thin covering on the crust. The crust is made of solid rock. </advanced>

          <advanced>He suggested that they started as a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Alfred, like earlier scientists, had noted that the coasts of South America and Africa could fit together. </advanced>
          <advanced>He also saw similar structures along the two coastlines. They share similar rock formations and fossils. He suggested that the drift began about 200 million years ago.</advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Convergent boundaries</simple>
          <advanced> At converging boundaries, plates come together. Although plates move just centimetres each year, they are so huge that we experience the effects of their collision.</advanced>
          <advanced> We can feel the earthquakes and see the mountains, including volcanoes, that grow at or near these boundaries. </advanced>
          <advanced>There are two kinds of converging boundaries.</advanced>
          <advanced>One kind of converging boundary happens where a trench forms. One plate carries oceanic crust, and the other one carries continental crust. As they push together, the heavier, thinner oceanic crust is forced down below the lighter, thicker continental crust. </advanced>
          <advanced> As one grinds down past the other, earthquakes rumble, and the continental crust wrinkles to form mountains. The oceanic crust moves lower into Earth and gets hotter and melts. This molten rock rises in some places to form volcanoes. </advanced>

          <simple>Weather</simple>
          <advanced>Weather is the day-to-day or hour-to-hour change in the atmosphere. Weather includes wind, lightning, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, rain, hail, snow, and lots more.</advanced>
          <advanced>Weather happens because different parts of the Earth get different amounts of heat from the Sun. This makes different climates. The tropics get the most heat because the Sun shines straight down on them, while the poles get the least heat because the Sun shines on them from a low angle. </advanced>
          <advanced>Weather is very important to life on Earth, it covers everything from rain, and storms to temperature</advanced>
          <advanced>Meteorology is the scientific study of weather. Meteorologists are people who study and predict, or forecast, the weather. Meteorology began in the 17th century when many instruments were invented to measure different weather conditions.</advanced>

          <simple>Weather</simple>
          <advanced> Air surrounds Earth like a blanket. This blanket of air is called the atmosphere. It is made up of many kinds of gases. It also contains dust particles and water. </advanced>
          <advanced> Scientists have divided the atmosphere into four different layers. We live in the bottom layer, and this is where weather occurs. In fact, scientists define weather as the condition of the atmosphere at any particular time and place. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Air</simple>
          <advanced>according to scientists, air is made up of different kinds of tiny particles. These particles are always moving. They bump into each other, and they bump into everything around them.</advanced>
          <advanced>Air pushes on trees, buildings, bicycles, furniture, and even you! Air pushes in all directions— up, down, and sideways.</advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Temperature</simple>
          <advanced>As the air around us heats up or cools down, we experience different temperatures. Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. </advanced>
          <advanced>We measure air temperature in order to find out how hot or cold the air is. Air temperature decreases as you move farther from Earth and higher up into the atmosphere.</advanced>

          <simple>Types of Magnets</simple>
          <advanced>Scientists call these objects magnetic. Likewise, they call objects that are not attracted to magnets non-magnetic.</advanced>
          <advanced>Magnets that we make can be temporary or permanent. Temporary magnets, such as the nail magnet you made in the last lesson, lose their magnetism quickly. Permanent magnets stay magnetized for a long time.</advanced>
          <advanced>All magnets have two ends called poles. Both poles can attract iron and nickel objects. The space around magnets is where magnetic forces act. Scientists call this space the magnetic field.</advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Types of sounds</simple>
          <advanced> We often group sounds as either natural (in nature) or artificial (made by people and our devices). </advanced>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Sound waves</simple>
          <advanced>When an object vibrates, it moves back and forth quickly. All matter is made of tiny particles. When sound causes the particles of a gas, liquid, or solid to vibrate, the movement passes from one particle to the next.</advanced>
          <advanced>This creates  a sound wave that travels out through the matter in all  directions, like the waves that a pebble makes when it is  dropped on water.</advanced>
          <advanced> Vibrations can be fast or slow. How fast a sound vibrates determines the pitch (high or low) of the sound.</advanced>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Loudness</simple>
          <advanced> The loudness of a sound is measured in decibels (dB).</advanced>
          <advanced> Normal talking measures about 60 dB and a soft whisper measures about 30 dB. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Cells</simple>
          <advanced> Scientists have found that our bodies are made of trillions of tiny cells. Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They  make up every part of you—your skin, your eyes, your brain, your stomach, your blood, and even your bones. </advanced>
          <advanced> Most cells are too small to see without a microscope. There are about 200 different kinds of cells in the human body. Each kind has a different size, shape, and function.</advanced>
          <advanced> For example, nerve cells carry electrical messages that control the body and white blood cells help keep you healthy. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Cells, tissues and Organs</simple>
          <advanced> Groups of similar cells make up tissues. Cells and tissues make up organs, which are parts of the body that perform certain jobs. Your eyes, ears, heart, and lungs are all organs. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Respritory System</simple>
          <advanced>Breathing helps bring oxygen into your body and take carbon dioxide out of your body. Scientists call this process respiration.</advanced>
          <advanced>Your respiratory system is  made up of all the cells, tissues, and organs that work together to make respiration happen. </advanced>
          <advanced> You use this system every time you breathe, but also when you cough, sneeze, speak, or move. The main organs in your respiratory system are your two lungs </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Circulatory system</simple>
          <advanced> Your circulatory system, which includes your heart, blood, and blood vessels, works with your respiratory system to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body. </advanced>
          <advanced> Blood flows constantly through hollow tubes in your body called blood vessels.  Two types of blood vessels are arteries and veins. Arteries carry blood away from your heart. Veins carry blood back to your heart. Scientists call the movement of blood around  your body circulation. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Heart</simple>
          <advanced>Your heart is an organ about the size of your fist. It is made up of muscle tissue, which can tighten and relax  </advanced>
          <advanced>Make a fist and notice how the muscles in your hand tighten. Now relax your hand.  Do you feel the difference? This is how  heart muscle works. </advanced>
          <advanced>When heart muscle tightens, blood flows out of the heart.  When heart muscle relaxes, blood flows into the heart. </advanced>
          <advanced>The left side of your heart pumps oxygen-rich blood that comes from your lungs to the rest of your body. As your cells use oxygen, they make carbon dioxide and other waste that the blood carries away. </advanced>
          <advanced>Blood is like a server who delivers lunch to your cells and then takes away the leftovers and garbage. The blood carrying wastes returns to the right side of the heart, which then sends it to the lungs. </advanced>
          <advanced>You inhale fresh air, the blood releases its carbon dioxide and picks up more oxygen, and the whole cycle starts all over again. And it all happens in about a minute!</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Digestive system</simple>
          <advanced>Your body needs fuel to grow and to function properly, the same way a car needs fuel to run. Oxygen, nutrients, andwater are the fuel for your body.</advanced>
          <advanced> Oxygen comes from the air, and nutrients come from food. Your digestive system breaks down the food so that your body can absorb the nutrients.</advanced>
          <advanced> The main part of your digestive system is a tube about nine metres long. It goes from your mouth to your anus, which is part of your small intestine. Many organs are part of this tube or attached to it. They include your stomach, liver, and intestines. </advanced>
          <advanced> Your digestive system is like a giant food processor: it chops, mashes, and mixes food into a soupy paste. </advanced>
          <advanced>The food’s journey through the digestive system starts in the mouth, when you chew and swallow. Moist pieces of food then travel down your  esophagus and into your stomach, and later into your intestines. There, digestive juices attack the food and break it down into even smaller pieces.</advanced>
          <advanced>Throughout your digestive system, chemicals called enzymes help break down food into nutrients. Some of the chemicals that help your body digest food are made or stored in the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Excretory system</simple>
          <advanced> Your body creates other waste products that it must get rid of. You already know about carbon dioxide, which exits your body through your respiratory system. Other waste products are removed by your excretory system.</advanced>
          <advanced> You have two kidneys that clean your blood and then return it to your circulatory system. The waste liquid left behind is called urine. The urine leaves each kidney though a tube called a ureter.</advanced>
          <advanced> The ureters are connected to your bladder. When your bladder is full, it sends a signal to your brain that you need to urinate. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Nervous system</simple>
          <advanced> As you have learned, the brain controls many processes in your body. The brain is your body’s main control centre. This organ sends and receives messages through your spinal cord and nerves. The brain, spinal cord, and nerves make up your nervous system. </advanced>
          <advanced> Your brain processes information from your nerves so that you know what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste. Your brain lets you know whether you are hot, or hungry, or in pain. </advanced>
          <advanced>Your brain also sends signals to all the other systems in your body to control your body’s activities, from walking to sweating.</advanced>
          <advanced> Your brain also uses hormons to communicate. Hormones are chemicals that act as messengers between body systems.</advanced>
          <advanced>You might remember your mouth watering after having smelled something good to eat. This is your digestive juices preparing for the intake of food. Your digestive system then takes over to digest the cookie. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>musculoskeletal system</simple>
          <advanced> The bones in your body form a skeleton, or framework, that holds your body up and gives it a shape. Many muscles work together with bones so that you can move, stand, and sit up. These muscles and bones are part of your musculoskeletal system.</advanced>
          <advanced> Your musculoskeletal system also protects the organs and tissues inside your body. </advanced>
          <advanced>Skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to bones. They are held to the bones by tendons.</advanced>
          <advanced>Tendons are long strips of tough tissue. Tendons help your body move but keep your  bones from being pulled too far out of position. You can feel tendons in your ankles and at the back of your knees. </advanced>
          <advanced> A joint is formed where two bones connect,  elbows, knees, and knuckles are all joints. </advanced>
          <advanced>There are 206 bones in the human skeleton. </advanced>
          <advanced>Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones on both sides of a joint. Muscles pull on the bones at a joint to cause movement. Muscles can pull but not push, so muscles often work in pairs to move different parts of your body. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Diseases</simple>
          <advanced>Diseases occur when organs or systems are not working properly. If an organ has a disease, has failed (is not functioning at all), or is missing, the body systems it belongs to may not work properly. </advanced>
          <advanced> For example, when someone is having a heart attack, the artery that carries blood to the  heart is blocked. Blood cannot reach the heart and the heart muscle may start to die. If blood cannot reach your heart, your heart cannot pump it out to the rest of your body. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Germs</simple>
          <advanced> Germs are tiny living things that can cause sickness or disease. Germs include bacteria  and viruses. </advanced>
          <advanced> Germs can get into your body through a break in the skin, such as a scratch or cut. Germs can also get in through your mouth, nose, ears, or eyes. If this happens, your body’s defences prepare to fight! </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Immune system</simple>
          <advanced> Your body’s immune system works to destroy any germs that get into your body. This system includes special cells, such as white blood cells, and organs that produce these cells. </advanced>
          <advanced> The organs in your immune system are located all around your body. They include your tonsils (two in the back of your throat) and your spleen (near your stomach).</advanced>
          <advanced> When your body senses an intruder, your immune system increases the number of the special cells that can fight it. Your circulatory system  then carries these cells to the site of the infection to fight off the intruder. </advanced>
          <advanced>The number of white blood cells in your body increases when you have an infection.</advanced>

          <simple>Types of tissue</simple>
          <advanced>There are four different tissue types in the human body: connective, epithelial, nervous, and muscle.</advanced>
          <advanced>The structures in your body are made up of different combinations of these four types of tissue. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Connective Tissue</simple>
          <advanced>Connective tissue supports other tissues and connects different parts of the body. Blood is a connective tissue and so are fat, bones, cartilage, and tendons. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Epithelial Tissue</simple>
          <advanced> Epithelial tissue covers the surface of your body and the outside of your organs. The skin and the linings of the various passages inside your body are made of epithelial tissue.</advanced>
          <advanced>Depending on its location, epithelial tissue may release substances to the surroundings or absorb substances from the surroundings.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple> Nervous Tissue</simple>
          <advanced>Nervous tissue carries messages to and from various parts of the body. Your brain, spinal cord, and nerves are all made of nervous tissue. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Muscle Tissue:</simple>
          <advanced>Muscle tissue allows your body to move. This tissue is specialized for contraction. Different muscle tissues pump blood through your body, push food through your intestines, and allow you to move the various structures in your body </advanced>

          <simple>Structures</simple>
          <advanced>
            A structure is made up of one or more parts put together that can support a load.
          </advanced>
          <advanced> Every structure has a form and a function. The  form is the basic shape; the function is its purpose. The function may be easy to identify—a ladder is for reaching higher up. </advanced>
          <advanced>Some structures have several functions—a rock can be used to heat up a sweat lodge, or be a seat or part of a wall. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Forces in and onstructures</simple>
          <advanced>All structures experience forces at all times. Sometimes the effects of those forces are not known until time has passed. That is why it is important to design a structure carefully, build it skilfully, and monitor it diligently throughout its useful life. </advanced>
          <advanced>
            Four properties describe how a force acts on a structure:
            • magnitude: the strength of the force
            • direction: the direction that the force is coming from
            • plane of application: the “slice” that the force travels along
            • point of application: the location where the force meets the
            structure
          </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>forces</simple>
          <advanced> The external forces acting on a structure are often referred to as the load. The total load is the sum of the static and dynamic loads.</advanced>
          <advanced>The static load is a force that does not move or change. The effect of gravity on a structure is an example of a static load. </advanced>
          <advanced>The dynamic load is made up of the forces that move or change while acting on a structure. Their magnitude, direction, and point or plane of application can change.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Internal forces</simple>
          <advanced>Some forces are caused by one part of a structure acting on other parts of the structure. This is an internal force. Examples include the tension in a stretched elastic and the compression caused by a roof pressing down on the walls of a building.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>

          <simple>Center of gravity and stability</simple>
          <advanced>The centre of gravity is the point at which a mass is equally balanced in all directions. </advanced>
          <advanced> Stability is a measure of how resistant a structure is to being knocked over. Stability depends on materials and construction techniques, as well as the centre of gravity. </advanced>
          <advanced>A table has a high centre of gravity but is usually stable if it has four legs relatively far apart. The closer together the legs are, the less stable it becomes. A table with one large leg in the middle tends to be more wobbly than a table with legs at each corner.</advanced>

          <simple>Structural stress</simple>
          <advanced> The bend in the shelf is a sign of  structural stress. When the book is removed, the shelf may go back to its original shape. </advanced>
          <advanced>Over time, repeated stress might crack the shelf. Permanent changes are signs of structural fatigue. Eventually, the shelf might collapse under the load of books. In that case, the external forces acting on the shelf were too strong. The result: structural failure.</advanced>

          <simple>Structural efficiency</simple>
          <advanced>Structural efficiency has to do with using the smallest amount of material to support a load. For example, to be efficient, the packaging for a remote control car should be the lightest needed to protect the car. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Viscosity</simple>
          <advanced>How fluids flow is determined by a property called viscosity.  Viscosity is a liquid’s internal resistance or friction that keeps it from flowing. </advanced>
          <advanced>Recall from the Particle Theory that the particles in a liquid slide around and roll over each other. In a gas, the particles move around more easily because they are far apart. </advanced>
          <advanced>In a fluid, the greater the friction or rubbing between the particles, the higher the viscosity. Fluids with a high viscosity do not flow as easily as fluids with a low viscosity. </advanced>
          <advanced>There are several ways to determine the viscosity of fluids. Two common ways you will investigate are the bubble test and the ramp method. </advanced>
          <advanced>In the bubble test, you time how long it takes an air bubble to rise through a tube of fluid. </advanced>
          <advanced>In the ramp method, you time how long it takes a fluid to flow down a ramp </advanced>
          <advanced> As temperature increases, the viscosity of a liquid decreases. Particles at higher temperatures move with more energy. Particles are able to move out of the way and make room for other particles to pass, allowing the liquid to flow more easily. </advanced>
          <advanced>The opposite is also true. As temperature decreases, the viscosity of a liquid increases. Particles at lower temperatures move with less energy. The spaces between particles get smaller, making less room for other particles to pass. This causes the liquid to flow less easily.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Volume</simple>
          <advanced>The volume of an object is a measure of how much space it takes up. Volume and mass are both important measurements when determining the density of an object. Density can be measured by finding the mass of a substance in a given volume. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Mass and weight</simple>
          <advanced>Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object, while the mass of an object measures the amount of matter that is in the object. </advanced>
          <advanced>If you were to go to the Moon, you would find that the force of gravity is one-sixth of that on Earth. The mass of an object on the Moon is the same as on Earth. So, what would happen to an astronaut’s weight when she travels to the Moon? </advanced>
          <advanced>Well because the force of gravity is one-sixth, and the mass remains the same, the weight will be one-sixth of the weight on Earth. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Density</simple>
          <advanced>Density is the amount of matter or number of particles in a given volume. The Particle Theory can help you understand density. </advanced>
          <advanced> The density of a substance is the ratio of its mass to its volume. This can be written as an equation: D = m / V</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Density and temperature</simple>
          <advanced>As particles move more rapidly, the space between them increases. This can cause two things to happen. First, the volume increases because the particles need more room to move. The volume increases, but the number of particles does not, meaning that the density decreases.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Floating</simple>
          <advanced>A force is a push or a pull that tends to cause an object to move or change its motion. </advanced>
          <advanced>Floating occurs when the upward force on an object is equal to or greater than the force of gravity pulling the object down.</advanced>
          <advanced> Objects in fluids may rise or sink if these two forces are not balanced forces. </advanced>
          <advanced>When an object is in a liquid, the force of gravity or gravitational force on the object pulls the object down toward Earth. The liquid, however, exerts an opposite force, called the buoyant force, and tries to push the object up. </advanced>
          <advanced> If the mass of the object is greater than the mass of the water the object displaces, then the gravitational force is greater than the buoyant force and the object will sink or dive. </advanced>
          <advanced>If the mass of the object is less than the mass of the water that the object displaces then the gravitational force is less than the buoyant force and the object will rise.</advanced>
          <advanced> The unit that scientists use for gravitational force is called the newton (N). It is equal to the amount of force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one metre per second per second.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Archimedes’ principle</simple>
          <advanced> Archimedes and the boat floated on the surface of the water. Archimedes made an important conclusion, known today as the Archimedes’ principle—the buoyant force acting on an object equals the weight or gravitational force of the fluid displaced by the object.</advanced>
          <advanced> For example, suppose you drop an object into a container. When the fluid rises, it will flow into the beaker. You already know that the volume of the displaced fluid equals the volume of the object. </advanced>
          <advanced>You are now discovering that the weight of that overflow fluid equals the buoyant force of  the fluid pushing up on the object.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Machines from fluids</simple>
          <advanced>Hydraulic devices use water or some other liquid in motion; pneumatic devices use air or other gases. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Pressure</simple>
          <advanced> They define pressure as the amount of force applied to a particular area, or force per unit area. The amount of pressure depends on two things: </advanced>
          <advanced>the amount of force being applied, measured in newtons (N), </advanced>
          <advanced>the size of an area the force pushes or pulls on, measured in square metres (m2)</advanced>
          <advanced>The more force you can apply to a given area, the greater the pressure. The pressure on a given area can also be changed by making the area smaller (for greater pressure) or larger (for less pressure).</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Compressability</simple>
          <advanced>Another property of fluids is compressibility, the ability to become more compact when squeezed. When a force pushes on an object, the object is said to be under compression. </advanced>
          <advanced>Objects under compression tend to deform in shape. For example, when you kick a soccer ball, the force of your foot compresses the ball and temporarily deforms it.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Pascals law</simple>
          <advanced>Pascal’s law states that when pressure is applied to a contained liquid, that pressure and force are transmitted without losing any force and in all directions throughout the liquid. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Hydraulic systems</simple>
          <advanced>Systems that use liquids in a confined space to transfer forces are called hydraulic systems. These systems operate according to Pascal's law. The liquid put into a hydraulic system is called hydraulic fluid. It is moved through the system by a pump.</advanced>
          <advanced> A hydraulic system can create a mechanical advantage. This  means that the output force is larger than the input force. </advanced>
          <advanced>In the hydraulic system, a fluid exerts the same amount of pressure throughout the system, so there is 16 times as much force being exerted by the fluid on the larger piston. </advanced>
          <advanced> The hydraulic fluid in a system is not used up. It continues to circulate throughout the system. A pump, a machine or device that displaces a fluid by physical or mechanical action, is used to force the fluid to flow, allowing it to move against gravity. </advanced>
          <advanced> Valves control the flow of fluid and keep the fluid flowing in the desired direction. </advanced>
          <advanced>There are many technologies that use hydraulic systems to move large, heavy objects easily. These include backhoes and excavators, and different systems in a vehicle including brakes and steering.</advanced>

      <lesson name="Light" topics="-1" level="5" index="122" inq="Why is it important to understand the rights of Native Americans?" score="0">
        <model section="1">
          <simple>Light</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about light, what it is, and how it is made</advanced>
          <advanced>Light is a form of energy. It travels faster than anything else</advanced>
          <advanced>Below you can expirement with light, mirrors and lenses</advanced>
          <advanced>Light travels in rays. A ray is a straight line of light. Most light sources send light in so many directions that it is hard to see just one ray.</advanced>
          <advanced> A directed straight line that represents the path followed by the light is called a ray. A ray diagram illustrates the direction of the path of light. Straight lines and an arrowhead indicate the direction the light travels. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Types of light sources</simple>
          <advanced>Light sources can be grouped as either natural or artificial. </advanced>
          <advanced> Natural light sources, such as fire or lightning, would exist without people. </advanced>
          <advanced>Artificial light sources, such as fireworks and light bulbs, are made by people.</advanced>
          <advanced> Light sources can also be grouped by whether they reflect (bounce) light from another source or emit (make their own) light. </advanced>
          <advanced> The Sun emits light and the Moon reflects light. Both of these light sources are Natural. </advanced>
        </model>

        //use these for more advanced grades --------------------
        //ok, so these will be the light sources you can choose from
        <model>
          <simple>Bioluminescence</simple>
          <advanced>The phenomenon of bioluminescence happens when a naturally occurring chemical reaction (see chemiluminescence below) takes place within a living organism and results in the emission of light.</advanced>
          <advanced> Fireflies and glow-worms (their larvae) use a complex reaction to make their tails glow. Other organisms such as shrimp, squid, and starfish use bioluminescence for communication.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some forms of fungi that cause wood decay glow at night. This creates the eerie nighttime phenomenon known as foxfire. Bioluminescence is a naturally occurring source of light.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Chemiluminescence</simple>
          <advanced>Items that glow in the dark (produce light) due to a chemicalreaction are described as chemiluminescent. When a glow stick is bent, the two liquids inside the stick mix, resulting in a chemical reaction.</advanced>
          <advanced>This chemical reaction causes the stick to glow for several hours until the chemical energy is depleted. In crime scene investigations, blood is detected from a luminol test. Luminol glows blue when it chemically reacts with iron in the blood. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Phosphorescent</simple>
          <advanced>These items when exposed to light absorbit and then glow. Phosphorescent materials absorb light energy, store it for long periods of time, and then release it as a form of light. </advanced>
          <advanced>Other items that use phosphorescence are photographic-darkroom timers and wristwatch dials.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>electroluminescence</simple>
          <advanced>semiconductor and light is emitted, the phenomenon is known as electroluminescence. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are technologies that  are applications of electroluminescence. </advanced>
          <advanced>Many wristwatches use electroluminescence to turn on a backlight. This produces a blue or green glow, allowing the numbers to be seen in the night </advanced>
        </model>



        //for each light source, it will have a luminecance
        <model>
          <simple>Luminance</simple>
          <advanced>Luminance intensity, also known as brightness, refers to the light that is emitted from the surface of an object such as a light or candle.</advanced>
          <advanced>The amount of light arriving at one place per unit area is referred to as illuminance. </advanced>
        </model>

        //this should be at the top-ish
        <model section="1">
          <simple>Optical Devices</simple>
          <advanced>You have seen that mirrors are good reflectors of light. Any tool that uses or makes light is called an optical device. Periscopes and kaleidoscopes are two devices that use mirrors to reflect light.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Transparent</simple>
          <advanced>Materials that allow light to shine through are called transparent. You can see through transparent objects because they do not scatter or stop light. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Translucent</simple>
          <advanced> Materials that allow some light to pass through are called translucent. You cannot see through translucent materials clearly. Only some light can pass through. Most of the light is scattered, bouncing off in all directions.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Opaque</simple>
          <advanced>Materials that block all light from passing through are called opaque. Opaque objects absorb all the light or cause it all to bounce off. Because no light can pass through, opaque objects such as blinds cast a dark shadow.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Refraction</simple>
          <advanced> When light passes from air to water and from water to air, it changes direction. That is what made the pencil in the glass of water look broken.</advanced>
        </model>

        //use this for higher grades
        <model>
          <simple>More refraction</simple>
          <advanced>When light travels through an interface between two regions at an angle other than 90°, it will most likely change direction depending on the properties of each region. </advanced>
          <advanced>For example, when light travels from  air to water, it will change direction toward the normal. When light travels from water to air it will change direction away from the normal. </advanced>
          <advanced>This change in direction happens if light travels at different speeds on either side of the interface. For example, light travels at different speeds through glass and water. The refractive index (or index of refraction) is a measure of how much the speed of light is reduced in the region. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Prism</simple>
          <advanced> Light also changes direction when it travels through a prism. A prism is a clear, smooth block with ends that are triangle shaped. </advanced>
          <advanced>Sunlight is a mixture of all of the colours of light. When sunlight passes through a prism, each colour of light shifts direction a little bit. Violet light changes direction more than red light does. This divides white light into stripes of colours, with red on one side and violet on the other. </advanced>
          <advanced>A rainbow contains all the colours of visible light that the human eye can see.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Reflection</simple>
          <advanced>If you use straight lines to represent the mirror and rays in a drawing, a line perpendicular to the mirror is called a normal. The angle between the incoming ray, the incident ray, and the normal is the angle of incidence. </advanced>
          <advanced>The angle between the reflected ray and the normal is the angle of reflection.</advanced>
          <advanced>Light behaves in the same way as the ball when reflecting off smooth and rough surfaces. Reflection off smooth surfaces results in a type of reflection known as specular (or regular) reflection. Mirrors, smooth metal surfaces, or calm water will create specular reflection. </advanced>
          <advanced> If light reflects off an uneven surface such as the ocean surface, diffuse reflection occurs. A rough surface causes reflected light to scatter in many directions.</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Electromagnetic radiation</simple>
          <advanced>However, the Sun emits many other types of energy which we cannot see. Scientists use the term  electromagnetic radiation to describe all of the energy that comes from the Sun. </advanced>
          <advanced>Some of this energy can be seen, some can affect our bodies, and some can be used to make technology work. For example, you may have heard about radio waves, ultraviolet rays, and gamma rays. Special devices are needed to detect those types of electromagnetic radiation.</advanced>
          <advanced>Electromagnetic radiation includes many types of energy from the Sun: visible light, infrared light which is sensed as heat, and ultraviolet light which causes tanning. </advanced>
        </model>

        //you left off here
        <model>
          <simple>Wave model of light</simple>
          <advanced>The wave model of light is used to explain all electromagnetic radiation. The movement of waves in straight lines is called rectilinear propagation. </advanced>
          <advanced>Just as each colour has its own wavelength, so does each of the invisible components of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, you  see only visible light. Your eyes are sensitive to the wavelengths  from red to violet. </advanced>
          <advanced>You cannot see the other waves because your eyes are not sensitive to their wavelengths. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Convex mirrors</simple>
          <advanced>When you are shopping, you may have noticed a large mirror in the store. Convex surveillance mirrors are used to monitor a large area. </advanced>
          <advanced>The outwardly-curved surface of a convex mirror reflects light from several parts of the room to the person’s eye so that a single mirror reflects a large area. Images in convex mirrors appear smaller than the object’s true size. </advanced>
          <advanced>Convex mirrors are also used in parking garages so drivers can see if an oncoming car is coming around the corner. School buses use convex mirrors, which allow the driver to see children in front of and beside the bus.</advanced>
          <advanced>When the object is far away from a convex mirror, the image is upright and very small. As the object comes closer to a convex mirror, the image remains upright and becomes larger, but is still smaller than the object.</advanced>
          <advanced> Convex mirrors produce only virtual images </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Concave mirrors</simple>
          <advanced>concave mirrors, ones in which the reflecting surface is curved inward like a bowl. Concave mirrors are used to  focus light rays or to create larger images.</advanced>
          <advanced>Common concave mirrors are those found in car headlights or those used to apply makeup. In the next activity, you will investigate the size and orientation of images in convex and concave mirrors. </advanced>
          <advanced> When the object is far away from a concave mirror, the image is upside down and smaller, but is a real image. When the object is very near, the image is upright and larger than the object. </advanced>
          <advanced>The enlarged images formed from concave mirrors when the object is very close are virtual images. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Virtual and real images</simple>
          <advanced> This image is known as a virtual image. Light does not pass through the mirror, it only  appears that light is travelling from this location. Curved mirrors can produce both virtual and real images.</advanced>
          <advanced> Real images are created on the same side of a concave mirror as the object; light passes through the image location and the image formed can be caught on a screen</advanced>

          <advanced>The objective lens or mirror of a telescope gathers the light. The greater its diameter, the more light it can collect. More light means more information from a planet or star. The light forms an  image, which can be magnified further by the eyepiece lens. </advanced>

          <simple>Matter</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about what matter, atoms, bonds, compounds and subatomic particles</advanced>
          <advanced>Matter is the substance of which all material is made. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.</advanced>
          <advanced>We all know when something takes up space, but what exactly is mass?</advanced>
          <advanced>Mass is simply the amount of matter in an object. If you hold a brick in one hand and a feather in your other hand, can you tell which object has more mass? </advanced>
          <advanced>The brick feels heavier, and therefor the brick has more mass. We can confirm this by using a scale to measure the mass of both objects.</advanced>
        </model>

        //new stuff =----------------
        <model section="1">
          <simple>Volume</simple>
          <advanced>The amount of space that something takes up is described in a measurement called volume</advanced>
          <advanced>Measuring the volume of something depends on its shape. For example, to measure the volume of a box-shaped object, we would measure its length, width, and height. Then, we multiply these three measurements together.</advanced>
          <advanced>If the measurements are in centimeters, the unit for volume is cubic centimeters (cm3).</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="1">
          <simple>Properties of matter</simple>
          <advanced>Matter can be experience with our senses, and they have different properties, let's take a look at a few of the common ones!</advanced>
          <advanced>Mass is the amount of matter in an object </advanced>
          <advanced>Volume is the amount of space an object takes up</advanced>
          <advanced>texture is what an object feels like when you touch it </advanced>
          <advanced>Hardness is the ability of an object to be scratched. For example glass can be scratched, but a diamond cannot.</advanced>
          <advanced>Flexibility is how much an object can bend before it breaks; a meter stick has some flexibility, but the top of a desk has very little or no flexibility. </advanced>
          <advanced>Absorbency is whether an object can soak up liquids; a tissue absorbs water, but plastic wrap does not.</advanced>
          <advanced>Buoyancy is whether an object floats; an ice cube floats in water, but a penny does not. </advanced>

          <simple>Bonds</simple>
          <advanced>All atoms would like to have a full outer shell, but the only elements to naturally have a full outer shell are the noble gases to the right of the periodic table. As a result, when atoms without full outer shells come into contact with other atoms, they tend to want to give up or gain electrons, this is called bonding</advanced>
          <advanced>The valence electrons are the number of electrons in an outer shell of an atom that can participate in forming chemical bonds with other atoms.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two general types of bonds that atoms can form: Ionic and covalent</advanced>
          <advanced>Ionic bonding occurs when one element donates an electron (or electrons) to another so that both elements will have a full outer shell.</advanced>
          <advanced>In covalent bonding electrons are shared between atoms rather than donated in order for the atoms of both elements to gain full outer shells. Electrons are always shared in pairs.</advanced>
          <advanced>After bonding, the atoms become more stable than before, and their energy levels become lower</advanced>
          <quiz>This happens between the valence (outer) shell of electrons of two or more atoms</quiz>
          <quiz>This is the process of sharing electrons</quiz>
          <quiz>Atoms form these to become more stable</quiz>

          <simple>Hydrogen</simple>
          <advanced>Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table. It is the simplest possible atom composed of one proton in the nucleus which is orbited by a single electron. Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements and is the most abundant element in the universe.</advanced>
          <advanced>At standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas.</advanced>
          <advanced>Hydrogen is very flammable and burns with an invisible flame. It burns when it comes into contact with oxygen. The byproduct of a hydrogen and oxygen explosion is water.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the first element in the periodic table</quiz>

          <advanced>Oxygen is an element with the chemical symbol O and atomic number 8. Under standard temperature and pressure conditions two oxygen atoms join to form dioxygen (O2), a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas.</advanced>
          <advanced>Oxygen is a very reactive element that easily forms compounds such as oxides.</advanced>
          <advanced>Oxygen is essential to human life, it is found in the air we breathe and the water we drink (H20).</advanced>
          <quiz>This element has chemical Symbol O</quiz>

          <simple>Compounds</simple>
          <advanced>A compound is a type of molecule with more than one element.</advanced>
          <advanced>Chemical compounds are formed when elements are joined by chemical bonds. These bonds are so strong that the compound behaves like a single substance. Compounds have their own properties that are unique from the elements they are made of. </advanced>
          <quiz>This is a type of molecule with one or more elements. </quiz>

          <simple>Electron cloud</simple>
          <advanced>The electron is a negatively charged particle that spins around the outside of the nucleus.</advanced>
          <advanced>Electrons spin so fast around the nucleus, scientists can never be 100% sure where they are located, therefore they are said to exist in shells</advanced>
          <advanced>Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons: the first layer can hold two electrons, the second layer eight electrons, the third layer eighteen electrons, etc.</advanced>
          <advanced> If there are the same number of electrons and protons in an atom, then the atom is said to have a neutral charge. </advanced>
          <advanced>Electrons have a mass of about 1/2000 of a proton, therefore, we say that they do not affect the mass of the atom, however, they're charge is equally strong as that of a proton</advanced>
          <quiz>This part of the atom has a negative charge</quiz>
          <quiz>This part of the atom contains electrons that spin around the nucleus</quiz>
