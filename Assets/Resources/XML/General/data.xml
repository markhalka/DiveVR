          <simple>Matter</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about matter, atoms, bonds, compounds and subatomic particles</advanced>
          <advanced>Matter is the substance of which all material is made. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. We all know when something takes up space, but what exactly is mass?</advanced>
          <advanced>Mass is simply the amount of matter in an object. If you hold a brick in one hand and a feather in your other hand, can you tell which object has more mass? The brick feels heavier, and therefore the brick has more mass.</advanced>
          <advanced>Now that we understand what matter is, lets learn more about atoms and compounds.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the substance of which all material is made</quiz>
          <quiz>This is anything that has mass and takes up space</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Bonds</simple>
          <advanced>All atoms would like to have a full outer shell of electrons, because this is when they are most stable. When atoms without full outer shells come into contact with other atoms, they want to give up or gain electrons, this is called bonding</advanced>
          <advanced>Only the very outside electrons can form bonds, these are called "valance electrons". There are two general types of bonds that atoms can form: Ionic and covalent</advanced>
          <advanced>Ionic bonding occurs when one element donates an electron (or electrons) to another so that both atoms will have a full outer shell. </advanced>
          <advanced>In covalent bonding electrons aren't donated, but shared between electrons. So for ionic bonding, electrons move completely from one atom to another, and in covalent bonding, the same electrons are used by both atoms to have a full outer shell</advanced>
          <advanced>After bonding, the atoms become more stable than before, and their energy levels become lower</advanced>
          <quiz>This happens between the valence (outer) shell of electrons of two or more atoms</quiz>
          <quiz>This is the process of sharing electrons</quiz>
          <quiz>Atoms form these to become more stable</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Hydrogen</simple>
          <advanced>It is the simplest possible atom composed of one proton in the nucleus which is orbited by a single electron. Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements and is the most abundant element in the universe.</advanced>
          <advanced>Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is also very flammable and burns with an invisible flame. It burns when it comes into contact with oxygen. The byproduct of a hydrogen and oxygen explosion is water.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the first element in the periodic table</quiz>
          <quiz>This gas is flammable, colorless and odorless</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Oxygen</simple>
          <advanced>Oxygen is a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas. The air, and even the water we drink has oxygen. Oxygen is a very reactive element that easily forms compounds such as oxides.</advanced>
          <quiz>This element has chemical Symbol O</quiz>
          <quiz>This element is very reactive, and easily forms compounds such as oxides</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Compounds</simple>
          <advanced>A compound is a type of molecule with more than one element.</advanced>
          <advanced>Chemical compounds are formed when elements are joined by chemical bonds. These bonds are so strong that the compound behaves like a single substance. Compounds have their own properties that are unique from the elements they are made of. </advanced>
          <advanced>For example, oxygen and hydrogen are both colorless, odorless gasses, but when they combine to form one compound, water, the new compound is completely different.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is a type of molecule with one or more element.</quiz>
          <quiz>This is formed when elements are joined together by chemical bonds</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Electron cloud</simple>
          <advanced>The electron is a negatively charged particle that spins around the outside of the nucleus. Electrons spin so fast around the nucleus, scientists can never be 100% sure where they are located, therefore they are said to exist in shells</advanced>
          <advanced>Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons: the first layer can hold two electrons, the second layer eight electrons, the third layer eighteen electrons, etc.</advanced>
          <advanced> If there are the same number of electrons and protons in an atom, then the atom is said to have a neutral charge. </advanced>
          <advanced>Electrons have a mass of about 1/2000 of a proton, therefore, we say that they do not affect the mass of the atom, however, they're charge is equally strong as that of a proton</advanced>
          <quiz>This part of the atom has a negative charge</quiz>
          <quiz>This part of the atom contains electrons that spin around the nucleus</quiz>
          <quiz>This part of the atom doesn't affect the weight of the atom</quiz>

          <simple>Nucleus</simple>
          <advanced>The nucleus contains two types of smaller particles. Protons which have a positive charge and neutrons which have no charge. Protons are the reason why a nucleus has a positive charge.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the central part of the atom</quiz>
          <quiz>This part of the atom consists of neutrons and protons</quiz>
          <quiz>This part of the atom has an overall positive charge</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Atom</simple>
          <advanced>The atom is the basic building block for all matter in the universe. Atoms are tiny and are made up of a few even smaller particles. Every atom can be thought of as a circular shape with two parts: a nucleus and electrons </advanced>
          <advanced>The nucleus is found at the center of every atom and has a positive charge.  Negatively charged electrons surround the nucleus and it's these two opposite charges that hold an atom together. </advanced>
          <quiz>This is the building block of all matter in the universe</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Neutrons</simple>
          <advanced>The neutron doesn't have any charge. The number of neutrons affects the mass and the radioactivity of the atom.</advanced>

          <quiz>This subatomic particle affects the mass, but not the charge of the atom</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Proton</simple>
          <advanced>The proton is a positively charged particle that is located at the center of the atom in the nucleus. Protons also affect the mass and charge of the atom, and have the same amount of mass of a neutron</advanced>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Temperature</simple>
          <advanced>Heat and temperature are two words that we use interchangeably every day, but they mean very different things in science!</advanced>
          <advanced>The temperature of something depends on how fast its particles are moving. In other words, temperature is related to the kinetic energy (the energy of movement) of the particles of matter.  </advanced>
          <advanced> Matter that has faster-moving particles (higher kinetic energy) has a higher temperature than matter that has slower-moving particles (lower kinetic energy). </advanced>
          <advanced>temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The unit for temperature is the degree Celsius.</advanced>
          <advanced>We say “average” kinetic energy because using the average kinetic energy gives a better indication of the energy of the particles. Some particles have more energy, and other have less.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance</quiz>
          <quiz>The unit of  measurement for this is Celsius</quiz>
        </model>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Heat</simple>
          <advanced>The amount of heat in an object depends on its temperature, mass, and composition. Heat is a form of energy. Therefore, heat is related to other forms of energy, such as sound energy, electrical energy, nuclear energy etc. </advanced>
          <advanced>All these types of energy have one thing in common: energy can cause matter to change. Heat (or heat energy), is the energy that is transferred from matter at a higher temperature to matter at a lower temperature.</advanced>
          <advanced>The SI unit for heat energy is the joule. </advanced>
          <advanced>Thermometers demonstrate the ability of heat to change matter. Adding heat energy to matter generally causes matter to expand—the volume increases. Removing heat energy from matter generally causes matter to contract—the volume decreases.</advanced>
          <advanced>Now that we understand heat, lets take a look at the particle theory of matter</advanced>
          <quiz>This is a form of energy, which is related to the transfer of temperature</quiz>
          <quiz>The unit of measurement for this is joule </quiz>
        </model>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Particle theory of matter</simple>
          <advanced>The following are the main ideas of the particle theory of matter:</advanced>
          <advanced>All matter is made up of extremely tiny particles, which are attracted or bonded to each other. The particles of matter are always moving and vibrating. This movement involves kinetic energy. Adding heat energy to matter makes the particles move around faster and vibrate faster.</advanced>
          <advanced>Faster-moving things have more kinetic energy. So adding heat energy increases the kinetic energy of the particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>The particles also have space between them. This is empty space not filled with air. Different states of matter have different amounts of space between the particles.</advanced>

        <model section="2">
          <simple>Kinetic particle theory</simple>
          <advanced>The kinetic particle theory explains the properties of the different states of matter. </advanced>
          <advanced>The particles in solids, liquids and gases have different amounts of energy. They are arranged differently and move in different ways.</advanced>
          <quiz>This theory says that different states have different amounts of energy, and this causes them to behave and move differently</quiz>
          <quiz>This theory explains the properties of the different states of matter</quiz>
        </model>

        <model section="2">
          <simple>Solid</simple>
          <advanced>A solid has a definite shape and volume. The shape of solid matter does not depend on the shape of the container holding it. Your desk is a solid.</advanced>
          <advanced>In a solid, the particles are close together, and do not move. They form a regular pattern, and vibrate in one location</advanced>
          <advanced>Solids can become either liquids, in a process called melting, or gasses, in a process called sublimation</advanced>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles close together, and is unable to change shape</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles vibrating in only one location</quiz>
          <quiz>Particles in this state cannot flow</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="2">
          <simple>Liquid</simple>
          <advanced>A liquid flows, has a fixed volume, and takes the shape of its container. Ketchup, water, and melted ice cream are liquids</advanced>
          <advanced>In a liquid the particles are close together, but they can still move around each other.</advanced>
          <advanced>Liquids can become solids in a process called freezing, or a gas in a process called boiling</advanced>
          <advanced>Boiling is not to be confused with evaporation, they are different in the following ways: evaporation can occur at any temperature - not just the boiling point </advanced>
          <advanced>It only happens at the surface of the liquid - not throughout like boiling, and finally boiling requires energy, whereas evaporation is the release of the highest energy particles</advanced>
          <quiz>This state of matter has particles close together, however, they are able to change shape</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter can both freeze, boil and evaporate</quiz>
          <quiz>This state of matter takes the shape of the container it is in, and is unable to be compressed</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="2">
          <simple>Brownian motion</simple>
          <advanced>Particles in both liquids and gases (collectively called fluids) move randomly. This is called Brownian motion. They do this because they are bombarded by the other moving particles in the fluid. Think of many ping pong balls flying and crashign into each other</advanced>
          <advanced>Brownian motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who first observed this in 1827. He used a microscope to look at pollen grains moving randomly in water. At this point, he could not explain why this occurred.</advanced>
          <advanced>But in 1905, physicist Albert Einstein explained that the pollen grains were being moved by individual water molecules. This confirmed that atoms and molecules did exist, and provided evidence for particle theory.</advanced>
          <quiz>This states that particles move randomly</quiz>
          <quiz>This theory helped prove that atoms and molecules exist, and provided evidence for the particle theory</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="2">
          <simple>Gas</simple>
          <advanced>A gas takes the shape and volume of its container. Smoke and steam are gases.</advanced>
          <advanced>In a gas the particles are far apart, in a random arrangement, and they move quickly in all directions</advanced>
          <advanced>Gasses flow and completely fill their container, this is because the particles can quickly move in all directions, and try to spread out as much as possible</advanced>
          <advanced>Gasses can be squished and compressed, this is because there is space between the particles themselves</advanced>
          <quiz>In this state of matter, the particles are far apart and move quickly</quiz>
          <quiz>In this state of matter particles can be compressed</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="2">
          <simple>Thermal expansion</simple>
          <advanced>All three states of matter (solid, liquid and gas) expand when heated. The atoms themselves do not expand, but the space between them, and therefore the volume does</advanced>
          <advanced>When a solid is heated, its atoms vibrate faster about their fixed points. The relative increase in the size of solids when heated is therefore small. </advanced>
          <advanced>Liquids expand for the same reason, but because the bonds between separate molecules are usually less tight they expand more than solids. </advanced>
          <advanced>Molecules within gases are further apart and weakly attracted to each other. Heat causes the molecules to move faster, which means that the volume of a gas increases more than the volume of a solid or liquid.</advanced>
          <quiz>This states that all states of matter expand when heated</quiz>

      <model>
        <simple>Physical Change</simple>
        <advanced>Physical changes happen when there is no change in the chemical formula. In other words, no chemical bonds were broken or created</advanced>
        <advanced>Some examples of physical change include changing states (such as a solid to a liquid). In general, its easy to undo physical changes (like freezing the water again) </advanced>
        <quiz>Ice melting is an example of this type of change</quiz>

     <model>
       <simple>Chemical Change</simple>
       <advanced>Chemical changes happen when the chemical formula becomes different. In other words, there was some chemical bond that was broken, or created.</advanced>
       <advanced>Some examples of chemical changes include burning, dissolving, and other chemical reactions. In general, its much harder to undo chemical changes. </advanced>
     <quiz>This type of change includes a change in composition</quiz>
     <quiz>Propane burning is an example of this type of change</quiz>
       <quiz>Metal rusting is an example of this type of change</quiz>

     </model>
       
     <model>
       <simple>Chemical bonds</simple>
     <advanced>Chemical bonds are forces that hold atoms together in a single molecule. Some examples of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, and covalent bonds.</advanced>
     <advanced>These bonds are very strong, and are difficult to break.</advanced>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Forming mixtures</simple>
          <advanced>One of the main aspects of chemistry is combining different substances. Sometimes combining substances can cause a chemical reaction and bonding which creates an entirely new substance called a compound.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, sometimes there is no chemical reaction or bonding. In this case, a mixture is formed from the combined substances.</advanced>
        </model>
        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Mixtures</simple>
          <advanced>A mixture is made when two or more substances are combined, but they are not combined chemically. A pure substance, such as table salt, is made up of just one type of particle. A mixture, such as soil, is made up of more than one type of particle.</advanced>
          <advanced> General properties of a mixture: The components of a mixture can be easily separated, the components each keep their original properties, the proportion of the components is variable</advanced>
        </model>
        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Types of mixtures</simple>
          <advanced>There are two main categories of mixtures: homogeneous mixtures and heterogeneous mixtures. </advanced>
          <advanced>In a homogeneous mixture all the substances are evenly distributed throughout the mixture (salt water, air, blood).</advanced>
          <advanced>In a heterogeneous mixture the substances are not evenly distributed (chocolate chip cookies, pizza, rocks)</advanced>
          <advanced>Within the categories of homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures there are more specific types of mixtures including solutions, alloys, suspensions, and colloids.</advanced>

          //these ones show up when you change the dropdown
          <simple>Solutions</simple>
          <advanced>A solution is a mixture where one of the substances dissolves in the other. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that does not dissolve is called the solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced>The amount of a solvent that we can dissolve is determined by the solubility. If you started to add sugar to water, you would notice that after a certain amount, it would stop dissolving, this amount is called the solubility</advanced>
          <advanced>Not all solutes and solvents form solutions. For example, if you added sand to water, it would not dissolve</advanced>
          <advanced>Some solutes “fit” with the solvent and dissolve. For example, sugar dissolves in water because the sugar particles bind (combine) with the water particles. Some solute particles do not bind with the solvent particles. Solutes that do not bind well are called insoluble solutes.</advanced>
          <advanced>Sometimes, it's possible to dissolve more of a solvent than normal, these solutions are called "super-saturated"</advanced>
          <advanced>Once a solution is formed, there are ways to separate solutions. these include filtration, distillation and decanting let's take a look at these below</advanced>
          <advanced>Filtration is a common technique used to separate solids from liquids. A common example used in many household kitchens is making coffee. The coffee grounds are in a coffee filter. Water drips onto the coffee grounds, absorbs the soluble coffee, and drips through the filter. The insoluble grounds are left behind because they cannot pass through the filter.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some solutions are made up of more than one solvent. In these solutions, a process called distillation can be used to separate a solid from a liquid or one liquid in a mixture from another. </advanced>

          <advanced>Bronze is a metal alloy. Bronze is mostly copper, with some tin added (usually between 5% and 20% tin).</advanced>
          <advanced>Bronze was the first alloy that was used by humans. The first nation that used Bronze was Egypt about 3500 years B.C. This gave the name for the Bronze Age.</advanced>
          <advanced>Bronze is stronger than copper or tin alone. Bronze lasts longer than copper. Pure copper can be oxidized by air and also by water. When copper is oxidized by air or water, it turns green (the color of "copper oxide"), and falls apart.</advanced>

          <simple>Steal</simple>
          <advanced>Steel is a mixture of several metals but most of it is iron. Steel is harder and stronger than iron. Steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02% and 1.7% percent carbon by weight. </advanced>
          <advanced>Steel has a long history. People in India and Sri Lanka were making small amounts of steel more than 2,500 years ago. It was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives.</advanced>
          <advanced> It is a very cheap metal and is used to make many things. Steel is used in making buildings and bridges, and all kinds of machines. Almost all ships and cars are today made from steel. When a steel object is old, or it is broken beyond repair, it is called scrap. It can be melted down and re-shaped into a new object. Steel is recyclable material; that is, the same steel can be used and re-used.</advanced>
          <quiz>This is one of the most common alloys in use today, and is used in machines, building, and cars among other things</quiz>

          <simple>Solder</simple>
          <advanced>Solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature. Here are two types of solder; soft solder and hard solder. Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work. Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two main types of soft solder; lead solder and lead-free solder. Lead solders have about 60% (or 63%) tin and 40% (or 37%) lead in them. Today lead solder is banned in many applications, because of its toxic effects</advanced>

          <simple>Suspensions</simple>
          <advanced>A suspension is a mixture between a liquid and particles of a solid. In this case the particles do not dissolve. The particles and the liquid are mixed up so that the particles are dispersed throughout the liquid. They are "suspended" in the liquid. A key characteristic of a suspension is that the solid particles will settle and separate over time if left alone.</advanced>
          <advanced>An example of a suspension is a mixture of water and sand. When mixed up, the sand will disperse throughout the water. If left alone, the sand will settle to the bottom.</advanced>
          <quiz>If I mix water and sand, it becomes this kind of mixture</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Colloids</simple>
          <advanced>A colloid is a mixture where very small particles of one substance are evenly distributed throughout another substance. They appear very similar to solutions, but the particles are suspended in the solution rather than fully dissolved.</advanced>
          <advanced>The difference between a colloid and a suspension is that the particles will not settle to the bottom over a period of time, they will stay suspended or float.</advanced>
          <quiz>This type of mixtures is similar to suspensions, but the particles do not settle over time</quiz>
          <quiz>This type of mixture has particles suspended and spread out in the solution</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Concentration</simple>
          <advanced>In chemistry, concentration is how much of a substance is mixed with another substance. In other words, it has many solute particles compared with the number of solvent particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>The substance that is dissolved (shown as the red dye in the example) is known as the solute. The substance in which the solute is dissolved (shown as the water in the example) is known as the solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced>To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute, or reduce the amount of solvent. To dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute.</advanced>
          <advanced>A dilute solution has small amounts of solute in a solvent, or has only a few solute particles compared with the number of solvent particles.</advanced>
          <advanced>Concentrated and dilute are relative terms. They tell you whether there are small or large amounts of solute in the solvent. But they do not tell you exactly how much solute is in a certain amount of solvent.</advanced>
          <advanced>The concentration of a solution tells you the amount of solute (in grams) dissolved in a certain amount of solution.</advanced>
          <advanced>For example, a solution with 50 g of solute dissolved in 100 mL of water is said to have a concentration of 50 g/100 mL of solution. This is read as “fifty grams per one hundred milliliters.”</advanced>
          <quiz>This describes the amount of a substance (the solute) that is dissolved in another substance (the solvent)</quiz>
          <quiz>This describes how dilute, or how concentrated a solution is</quiz>

          <simple>Energy Sources</simple>
          <advanced>In this module, you will learn about the different ways we generate electricity today</advanced>
          <advanced>There are two types of energy sources, renewable and non-renewable. As we begin to need and depend more on energy, it is more important than ever to understand each of the different sources. As well as their pros and cons. </advanced>
          <advanced> A renewable energy resource can be used over and over. It is never used up. </advanced>
          <advanced> energy resource can only be used once. This is because most non-renewable energy resources are fossil fuels made from the organic remains of plants and animals. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form and therefore cannot be quickly replaced. </advanced>

        <model>
          <simple>Nuclear power</simple>
          <advanced>Nuclear power is the controlled use of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is energy in uranium that can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor. This energy is made into electricity, which then can be used to power machines and heat homes.</advanced>
          <advanced>14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power. Nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly. Nuclear power plants produce less radioactive material than a coal-fired power station</advanced>
          <advanced>Nuclear power plants operate on a process known as fission, which takes a larger molecule and breaks it into smaller pieces, releasing energy in the process</advanced>
          <advanced>The sun uses a process known as nuclear fusion, which joins two smaller molecules together to form a larger one, releasing a huge amount of heat. Researchers hope to use this form of energy in the future, as it is safer, more efficient, and greener than any current technology</advanced>

          <advanced>There are several things to consider nuclear energy. Nuclear power plants are expensive to build and maintain. </advanced>
          <advanced> A nuclear power plant functions for 30 to 50 years before it must be decommissioned. The waste is highly radioactive and must be carefully handled and stored for a long period of time. Chances of a nuclear accident must be minimized. </advanced>

          <quiz>It generates energy from radioactive materials</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source operates on a process known as nuclear fission</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source has caused many disasters, such as Chernobyl, or Three Mile Island</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Hydro power</simple>

          <advanced>Hydroelectricity is electricity generated by the force of water. Hydroelectric generating stations create electricity by having a flow of water turn a generator. </advanced>
          <advanced>A spinning generator changes the energy of its motion into electrical energy.</advanced>
          <advanced>Water needed to spin the generator usually comes from a river that has been blocked by a dam. The blocked water forms a reservoir that can be used for both recreational activities and farm irrigation.</advanced>
          <advanced>With a dam, there will always be water available to turn the generators and make electricity.</advanced>
          <advanced>Dams are expensive to build and so are the long transmission lines that carry electricity from the dams to businesses and homes.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, hydroelectric power generators run without creating pollution, and they are reasonably cheap to operate. </advanced>
          <advanced>Unlike other energy resources, hydroelectric power generators can be started and stopped in a matter of minutes. This makes them more flexible to use during high demand times.</advanced>
          <advanced>There are only a limited number of places where hydroelectric dams can be built because of impacts on the environment and local communities. When a dam and reservoir are created, flooding of the surrounding land affects the habitat of all plant and animal life in the area. </advanced>

          <quiz>This form of power uses the flowing of water to generate electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source can cause flooding in some areas, and can damage the ecosystem</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Oil and Coal power</simple>
          <advanced>Almost half of the world’s electricity comes from burning coal. </advanced>
          <advanced>Coal is burned to heat water into steam, which is then used to spin generators to create electricity. The process is similar to the generators in dams, except that in dams water is used instead of steam. </advanced>
          <advanced> Using coal for making electricity is relatively cheap, and the world has a large quantity of coal available. An added benefit of using coal is that other products can be made from it. These products include fertilizers, paints, and plastics.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, using coal has disadvantages. Mining coal can be dangerous and disruptive to the environment, so mining companies are required to try to restore the land to its original form when they have completed the mining process.</advanced>
          <advanced>Burning coal can create air and water pollution and is often considered one of the “dirtiest” forms of energy generation. As coal is non-renewable, it will eventually be used up, or be too expensive to mine.</advanced>

          <quiz>This is our main form of generating electricity currently, however it is harmful to the environment</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source uses organic material that is millions of years old</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Wind power</simple>
          <advanced>Wind energy is the energy from the bulk movement of air. Wind is caused by pressure differences in the atmosphere which are caused by uneven heating of the earth by the sun. </advanced>
          <advanced>Air moves from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, which produces wind as a result.</advanced>
          <advanced> Wind power is the fastest growing renewable energy source. It is also the most widely available renewable energy source in the world.</advanced>

          <advanced>Collecting energy from the wind requires a windmill, turbine, or blade to catch and turn in the wind. There are many types of devices that can be used but the multi blade and two- or three-blade high-speed rotors are the most common. </advanced>
          <advanced>Wind is free, renewable, and emission free, and  windmills can be set up faster than dams or coal power plants.</advanced>
          <advanced> Unfortunately, wind speed is variable, turbines break down, birds can be killed flying into them, and the electricity is expensive to generate. Also, a large area  of land is needed for “wind farms.” </advanced>
          <advanced> the long-term effects of wind farms on the land are not known. There is the possibility of noise pollution from the sound of the blades for those living close by.</advanced>

          <quiz>This is the fastest growing renewable energy source</quiz>
          <quiz>This energy source uses the movement of air to create electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This energy source can be over 100 meters tall</quiz>

          <simple>Solar power</simple>
          <advanced>Solar energy is the energy that is in sunlight. Solar power plants convert sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).</advanced>
          <advanced>concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.</advanced>

          <advanced>The collection and use of the free heat energy from the Sun for household heating is called passive solar heating.</advanced>
          <advanced>When solar energy is used in conjunction with other electrical devices, it is called active solar heating.</advanced>
          <advanced>Solar energy is simple to use. It can be added to houses quite easily. There is generally no visible pollution when solar energy is used to generate electricity.</advanced>
          <advanced>However, using solar energy to generate electricity does have some problems. The Sun only shines for part of the day, and some days may be cloudy.</advanced>
          <advanced>A solar cell used to generate electricity is quite expensive.  Generating electricity from solar energy also takes up a lot of space. Many generating projects using solar energy are small-scale because it would take a large area of land to produce a vast amount of electricity.</advanced>

          <quiz>This form of energy uses the technology of photovoltaics, or concentrated solar power, to generate electricity</quiz>
          <quiz>This form of energy can only produce electricity during the day</quiz>

          <simple>Biomass</simple>
          <advanced>Biomass is any plant or animal material that can be safely burned and makes a good fuel. Most organic material, trees and shrubs, and most agricultural material, for example, grains or crops, can be used as biomass. Even animal manure is used. </advanced>
          <advanced> Biomass energy generation reuses organic material to produce energy. Biomass is burned to create steam in electricity generators similar to those fueled by wind and geothermal energy. </advanced>
          <advanced> Reusing these wastes has great potential not only as an efficient energy source, but also as a positive impact on the environment. Landfills and waste centers could be used less, and the supply of waste never runs out! </advanced>
          <advanced> The supply of biomass would be cheap, but the cost of building a new generation unit is very expensive. Also, people need to be careful about what is used as biomass. Some waste products, like plastic, should not be burned.</advanced>
          <advanced>Because biomass use is relatively new, there are not many rules on how much, or what, should be burned. Many people are concerned that if burning biomass is not properly regulated, companies might start burning materials that are not considered “waste.” </advanced>

          <quiz>This is the use of animal or plant remains for energy</quiz>
          <quiz>This is a relatively new form of energy, and there are not many rules, which could lead to environmental problems</quiz>
          <quiz>This power source not only creates energy, but also decreases waste</quiz>

          <advanced>In this module you will learn about how flying works, and the different ways we fly today</advanced>
          <advanced>Before we learn about flight, lets review a little about forces</advanced>
        </model>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Forces</simple>
          <advanced>For scientists, a force causes an object’s motion to change. It can be a push or a pull. </advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Gravity and Lift</simple>
          <advanced> Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects that have mass. For example, you are pulled toward Earth, and Earth is pulled toward you. </advanced>
          <advanced>Scientists call this pull gravity. They have found that the more mass an object has, the greater the force of gravity between Earth and that object </advanced>

          <advanced>Living things that fly must experience a force that goes against gravity. Scientists call such a force lift. </advanced>
          <advanced>For something to fly there must be enough lift to overcome the force of gravity. Naturally, birds require less lift to fly than airplanes. The lighter the object, the less lift required. </advanced>

          <quiz>This is the force that goes against gravity</quiz>
          <quiz>In order to fly, this force must be equal to or greater than gravity</quiz>

          <quiz>this is the force of attraction between two objects that have mass</quiz>
          <quiz>All objects must overcome this force in order to fly</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Thrust and Drag</simple>
          <advanced>Thrust is the scientific name of the force that pushes any animal or object forward. Birds and insects get their thrust and lift from flapping their wings. </advanced>

          <advanced>Drag is the scientific name of a force that slows you down. Drag resists motion. As birds and insects move through the air, the air pushes against their movement, creating drag. </advanced>

          <quiz>This is a force that slows you down</quiz>
          <quiz>This force is caused by air pushing against the movement of an object</quiz>

          <simple>Internal combustion engines</simple>
          <advanced>Early airplanes used an internal combustion engine, an engine in which the fuel is burned within the engine itself. This engine powered the propeller, which provided thrust. </advanced>
          <quiz>This was used in early airplanes</quiz>
          <quiz>This is what powered the propeller in early airplanes</quiz>

          <simple>Jet Engines</simple>
          <advanced>Henri Coanda’s first jet engine created thrust differently. Jet engines work by igniting fuel and compressed oxygen inside the engine.</advanced>
          <advanced>This causes a large amount of exhaust gas to be released out of the rear of the aircraft, creating a large force. This force propels the aircraft forward.</advanced>
          <quiz>This engine was invented by Henri Coanda</quiz>
          <quiz>This engine ignites fuel and compressed oxygen</quiz>

          <simple>Rocket</simple>
          <advanced>Rocket engines have been used to create thrust in rockets, airplanes, and spacecraft. All rocket engines accelerate a fluid for this purpose. </advanced>
          <advanced>In a chemical rocket engine, a fuel is burned, creating exhaust gases. High pressures and temperatures help to push the exhaust gases through a narrow rocket nozzle. </advanced>
          <advanced>Earlier, you learned that if the width of a passageway is narrowed, a fluid will move through it more quickly. This causes the exhaust gases to accelerate as they pass through the rocket nozzle, and thrust is created. </advanced>
          <quiz>This engine uses a narrow nozzle to propel the exhaust gasses out, and create thrust</quiz>

          <simple>Rocks and minerals</simple>
          <advanced>Rocks and minerals are all around us, and they can be found from building materials to medicine and pharmaceuticals</advanced>
          <advanced>This module will introduce you to the three types of rocks, as well as some common rocks and minerals</advanced>
          <advanced>Geologists are scientists who study rocks. </advanced>
          <advanced>To a geologist, a rock and a mineral are two different things that occur in nature.</advanced>
          <advanced>Imagine two chocolate bars. One is pure chocolate, and the other has caramel and nuts in it. The pure chocolate bar is like a mineral. In science, a mineral is a solid that is made of the same substance throughout.</advanced>
          <advanced>The chocolate bar that contains nuts and caramel is like a rock. A rock is a solid that is made of two or more minerals. </advanced>
        </model>


        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Minerals</simple>
          <advanced>All rocks are made of minerals. A mineral is a pure substance that forms naturally as a solid in Earth. </advanced>
          <advanced> Some rocks, such as limestone, are formed of only one mineral. Other rocks, such as granite, are made up of several minerals.</advanced>
          <advanced>Minerals are classified by their chemical composition (by what chemicals are in them).</advanced>
          <advanced>You may have heard the names of some of the most common minerals, such as quartz and mica. There are thousands of different minerals, and these can combine to form many kinds of rocks. </advanced>
          <advanced>you do not have to know thousands of minerals to be able to identify most of the rocks you will find. Just five minerals combine in different ways to form most of the rocks in Earth’s crust.</advanced>
          <advanced> These minerals are, calcite, quartz, feldspar, mica, hornblende</advanced>
          <advanced>Two rocks can have exactly the same minerals in them, but they may look different because they formed in different ways. The way the minerals are arranged and the sizes of the individual grains can all give clues to how a rock formed.</advanced>

          <simple>Calcite</simple>
          <advanced>Calcite is a common rock forming mineral</advanced>
          <advanced>Calcite is found in all 3 types of rocks</advanced>
          <advanced>It is used in all parts of our lives, from construction to pharmaceutical industries</advanced>

          <simple>Sedimentary rock</simple>
          <advanced>rocks at or near Earth's surface are broken into smaller pieces by water, wind, and ice. Soil and shell pieces are also moved along with rock pieces. </advanced>
          <advacned>The pieces (called sediment) often settle in layers, such as in desert dunes and on the bottoms of  rivers, lakes, and oceans.</advacned>
          <advanced> Over millions of years, the layers are squeezed together. The weight and pressure of the layers above cause the sediment to become cemented together to form new rock.</advanced>
          <advanced>This is how igneous, metamorphic, and older sedimentary rocks are recycled to become newsedimentary rocks. </advanced>
          <quiz>It is formed over time at the bottom of lakes</quiz>

          <simple>Igneous rock</simple>
          <advanced>The rock shown here is Gnaisse which is a common form of igneous rock</advanced>
          <advanced>Igneous rocks are formed from volcanic activity, under high heat and pressure</advanced>
          <advanced>Igneous rock covers the ocean floor, so two- thirds of Earth’s surface is igneous rock! In fact, all types of rocks on Earth began as igneous rock. </advanced>

          <simple>Metamorphic rock</simple>
          <advanced>A metamorphic rock is a type of rock which has been changed by extreme heat and pressure. Its name is from 'morph' (meaning form), and 'meta' (meaning change).</advanced>
          <advanced>The original rock may be sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock.</advanced>
          <advanced>for example marble is a metamorphic rock formed from limestone.</advanced>

          <simple>Weathering</simple>
          <advanced>Weathering is one of the reasons that rocks change. Weathering is the process that wears down rocks and other objects. </advanced>
          <advanced>Think back to the types of rock you studied earlier: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Even though most of Earth’s crust is made of igneous rocks, many of the rocks we see on the surface are sedimentary rocks.</advanced>
          <advanced>Most sedimentary rocks form from tiny rock fragments piling up and being pressed together. Where did the fragments come from? Weathering breaks rocks into tiny pieces, which helps to form sedimentary rocks and soil. </advanced>
          <advanced>there are many different types of weathering, lets take a look at them!</advanced>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Mechanical weathering</simple>
          <advanced>Mechanical weathering happens when rock is broken apart by physical forces such as water or wind. In our climate, rock is often broken down by water freezing in cracks</advanced>
          <quiz>This type of weathering happens when rock is broken by physical forces, such as water</quiz>
          <quiz>This type of weathering can be caused by water or wind</quiz>

        <model>
          <simple>Chemical weathering</simple>
          <advanced>Chemical weathering happens when water in the air combines with chemical substances in the air. Sometimes these substances are in the air naturally. Sometimes they are there because of cars, fires, and smoke from industry. </advanced>
          <advanced>combined with the rain or snow, the substances form solutions called acids. Rocks exposed to these acids gradually wear away.</advanced>

          <simple>Greenhouse gases</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about the common greenhouse gasses, and the effect they have on our atmosphere and climate</advanced>
        </model>
        <model section="-1">
          <simple>The Greenhouse effect</simple>
          <advanced>Greenhouse gases reflect radiation that the Earth emits, and stop it from being lost into space. This causes the Earth's temperature to be higher than it would be without greenhouse gases. The name for this is the "greenhouse effect."</advanced>
          <quiz>This is the effect that causes radiation to be reflected back to Earth</quiz>
        </model>
        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Greenhouse gasses</simple>
          <advanced>Most greenhouse gases are natural - water vapor is the most common, and causes most of the greenhouse effect on Earth. Other greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbon and ozone.</advanced>
          <advanced>Without greenhouse gases, the earth would be on average 33 degrees Celsius colder.</advanced>
          <quiz>These are gasses that cause the greenhouse effect</quiz>
          <quiz>Without these gasses the earth would be 33 degrees colder</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Water vapour</simple>
          <advanced>Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, both by weight and by volume </advanced>
          <advanced>Water vapour will generally stay in the atmosphere for days (before precipitating out) while other greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide or methane, will stay in the atmosphere for a much longer period of time (ranging from years to centuries) thus contributing to warming for an extended period of time.</advanced>
          <advanced>Increased water vapor content in the atmosphere is referred to as a feedback process. Warmer air is able to hold more moisture. As the climate warms, air temperatures rise, more evaporation from water sources and land occurs, thus increasing the atmospheric moisture content. </advanced>
          <advanced>The water vapour feedback process is most likely responsible for a doubling of the greenhouse effect when compared to the addition of carbon dioxide on its own </advanced>
          <quiz>This is the most abundant greenhouse gas</quiz>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas causes a feedback loop that doubles the greenhouse effect</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Carbon dioxide</simple>
          <advanced>Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring gas, that is released from decaying and living organisms, as well as volcanoes</advanced>
          <advanced>Carbon dioxide is also released when burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil, and it is the most important contributor to man-made greenhouse gasses</advanced>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is released by living and decaying organisms, as well as volcanoes</quiz>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is the most important contributor of man-made greenhouse gasses</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Methane</simple>
          <advanced>Methane is a normal gas released from wetlands, growing rise, raising cattle, using natural gas, and mining coal</advanced>
          <advanced>However, methane traps a lot of heat, and is considered the second most important contributor to man-made greenhouse gasses</advanced>
          <quiz>This greenhouse gas is released from wetlands, growing rice, and mining coal</quiz>
        </model>
        <model>
          <simple>Nitrous oxide</simple>
          <advanced>Nitrous oxide is a natural part of the nitrogen cycle, and is released from bacteria in the soil and ocean</advanced>
          <advanced>However, it is also released by some factories, power plants, and fertilizers. This gas damages the protective ozone layer, and is extremely powerful </advanced>

          <simple>Evaporation</simple>
          <advanced>Energy from the sun causes water to evaporate from bodies of water</advanced>
          <advanced>The main factors affecting evaporation are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.</advanced>
          <advanced>The principal source of water vapour is the oceans, but evaporation also occurs in soils, snow, and ice.</advanced>
          <advanced>Around 90 percent of the water vapor in the atmosphere got there through evaporation.</advanced>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Sun</simple>
          <advanced> The Sun is on average 149 600 000 km, or one astronomical unit (1AU), away from Earth. It takes about 9 min for light to travel from the Sun to Earth.</advanced>
          <advanced>The Sun creates its energy mainly by combining hydrogen nuclei to produce helium nuclei, in a process called nuclear fusion. In this process, the Sun releases energy in the form of light, heat, and radioactive material.</advanced>
          <advanced>At its core, the heat of the Sun is estimated to be over 15 000 000 °C. </advanced>
          <advanced>The Sun is a medium-sized star, called a yellow dwarf</advanced>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Mercury</simple>
          <advanced>Mercury is the smallest, and closest planet to the sun</advanced>
          <advanced>It has the greatest range of temperature, from as hot as 370 °C to as cold as –150 °C. How hot or cold it can be depends on which side is facing the Sun.</advanced>
          <advanced>It completes one full revolution around the sun in 88 days</advanced>
          <advanced>Mercury has no atmosphere</advanced>

          <quiz>It is the smallest planet in the solar system</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Venus</simple>
          <advanced>Venus has a thick atmosphere, of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid</advanced>
          <advanced> Not only does the cloud reflect light, it also traps heat on the planet, just like a greenhouse. The planet’s temperature can reach 484 °C — hot enough to melt lead. </advanced>
          <advanced>The “greenhouse effect” also affects the weather on the planet. Winds on Venus have been estimated to be 380 km/h. That’s faster than most tornadoes!  </advanced>
          <advanced>Earth and Venus are about the same size and mass. Both have an iron core surrounded by a rocky surface. This is why Venus and Earth are called “twin” planets. </advanced>
          <advanced> This rocky surface also has a number of impact craters and mountains, but a lot of the surface of Venus has been shaped by volcanic activity. </advanced>
          <advanced> We also know that Venus spins in the opposite direction to Earth. This means that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. </advanced>
          <quiz>It has clouds made of acid</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Earth</simple>
          <advanced>Earth is the only known planet with life</advanced>
          <advanced>Earth's atmosphere is made up of about 80% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen</advanced>
          <advanced> 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by water. It is the only planet with oceans of warm water. The planet’s oceans help to keep Earth’s temperature fairly constant.</advanced>
          <advanced>The atmosphere also protects us from meteoroids. When a meteoroid, a fragment of space rock, enters Earth’s atmosphere, friction causes the meteoroid to burn up and be seen as the streak of bright light in a meteor.</advanced>
          <advanced>Some meteors and asteroids have hit Earth though. Scientists believe that Hudson Bay was created when an asteroid hit Earth millions of years ago. These impacts have helped to shape Earth’s surface, but the surface has also been created by volcanic and tectonic activity.</advanced>
          <advanced>Tectonic activity is the back-and-forth movement of “plates” that float on the top layer of Earth</advanced>

          <quiz>The surface of this planet is 70% water</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Mars</simple>
          <advanced>temperatures range from –70 °C during its winter to 22 °C in the Martian summer. During the winter, ice caps which cover the south and north poles, increase after shrinking in the summer. These ice caps, however, are not made out of water. They are similar to dry ice.</advanced>
          <advanced>The atmosphere of Mars is thinner than that of Earth and gives less protection. The surface of Mars has been affected by the impact of meteorites, large fragments of space rock that may collide with planets.</advanced>
          <advanced>The surface of Mars is covered in a variety of rocks and an iron-rich clay soil. </advanced>
          <advanced>The planet gets its reddish appearance because the soil “rusts.” The surface is also covered with volcanoes, mountains, canals, and canyons. Some of these are the largest and deepest in the solar system.</advanced>

          <quiz>This planet is covered in a layer of iron oxide</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Jupiter</simple>
          <advanced> Jupiter is the largest of all the planets. It is so large that all the other planets in our solar system could fit inside it. </advanced>
          <advanced>Jupiter has over 50 moons, some of which are as large as planets</advanced>
          <advanced>Because Jupiter rotates so quickly, its gases are stretched out into bands that go around the entire planet. The different colours of Jupiter are caused by the clouds that surround it. </advanced>
          <advanced>These clouds are made up of different materials and are at different heights. For example, the white bands are made of frozen ammonia, and the blue bands are made of water.</advanced>
          <advanced>These gas clouds help to create the weather on Jupiter as well. The most identifiable feature of Jupiter is its Great Red Spot. This red spot is actually a storm of clouds on the planet that has winds of over 320 km/h. It is just like a hurricane.</advanced>
          <quiz>It is the largest planet in our solar system</quiz>

          <simple>Saturn</simple>
          <advanced>Saturn is made of mostly hydrogen and helium</advanced>
          <advanced>Saturn has rings made of dust and ice</advanced>
          <advanced>Saturn has over 52 moons</advanced>
          <advanced>One year on Saturn is over 10,759 Earth days</advanced>

          <advanced>Saturn is best known for its impressive system of rings that surround this faint greenish-coloured gas giant. These rings measure 260 000 km across, but are only 14 m in thickness. </advanced>
          <advanced>Sometimes the rings look solid because they are made up of space “snowballs.” Some of these snowballs are as big as a house! </advanced>
          <advanced> Astronomers believe that the rings of Saturn come from the breakup of natural satellites that once revolved around the planet. Many satellites still orbit Saturn.</advanced>
          <advanced>Just like its neighbors, Saturn does not have a solid surface and it also has different-coloured spots. However, Saturn differs greatly from Jupiter. It is much lighter, or less dense.</advanced>
          <advanced> Since it is so light, and it rotates so quickly, Saturn’s shape is like a squished balloon. It oblates, or spreads out, along its equator. Much information on Saturn has been gained from space probes. The international Cassini mission has transmitted more than 140 000 images since 2004.</advanced>
          <quiz>This planet is famous for its rings</quiz>
        </model>


        <model>
          <simple>Uranus</simple>
          <advanced>Uranus is the 7th planet from the sun, and the third gas giant, after Jupiter and Saturn</advanced>
          <advanced>Uranus has been tipped on its side, most likely by another planet</advanced>
          <advanced>Uranus has 27 moons named after characters from William Shakespeare</advanced>

          <advanced>The third of the Gas Giants, Uranus is often called an “Ice Gas Giant” because its atmosphere is made up of different types of ices. One of the chemicals is methane. It is the methane gas that gives Uranus its blue-green colour. </advanced>
          <advanced> Its rings, which are a characteristic of all the Gas Giants, are very difficult to see. They were not discovered until 1977, and even the Hubble Space Telescope often has trouble seeing the 11 dark rings. </advanced>\
          <advanced> Uranus is the only planet in our solar system to spin on its side, and, just like the planet Venus, it has retrograde motion. </advanced>
          <advanced>Astronomers believe that Uranus is on its side because it collided with a large object early in its history. Since Uranus is tilted so much, its north and south poles experience 42 years of light and 42 years of darkness. As well, each season lasts 21 years! </advanced>
          <quiz>This planet has been tipped on its side</quiz>
        </model>

        <model>
          <simple>Neptune</simple>
          <advanced>Neptune is often compared to a large, round, blue Popsicle. This Popsicle has a centre (core) of melted rock. Around this rocky core is extremely cold water. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune gets its blue colour from methane. </advanced>
          <advanced>Remember how the Gas Giants create their own heat? Neptune is about 4.3 billion km from the Sun so any energy it gets from the Sun is much less than what we get on Earth. From this distance, the Sun looks like just another bright light in Neptune’s sky. </advanced>

          <advanced>Water is the common name for dihydrogen monoxide or H2O. </advanced>
          <advanced>In theory, it's easy to make water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Mix the two gases together, add a spark or sufficient heat to provide the activation energy to start the reaction, and presto—instant water.</advanced>
          <advanced>Merely mixing the two gases at room temperature, however, won't do anything, energy must be supplied to break the covalent bonds that hold H2 and O2 molecules together.</advanced>
          <advanced>When the chemical bonds re-form to make water, additional energy is released, which propagates the reaction. The net reaction is highly exothermic, meaning a reaction that is accompanied by the release of heat.</advanced>

          <simple>Waves</simple>
          <advanced>In this module you will learn about basic wave terminology</advanced>
          <advanced>There are lots of waves all around us in everyday life. Sound is a type of wave that moves through matter and then vibrates our eardrums, so we can hear. Light is a special kind of wave that is made up of photons. You can drop a rock into a pond and see waves form in the water. We even use waves (microwaves) to cook our food </advanced>
          <advanced>Waves can be divided into various categories depending on their characteristics. All waves can be categorized as either mechanical or electromagnetic.</advanced>
        </model>
        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Mechanical waves</simple>
          <advanced>Mechanical waves are waves that require a medium. This means that they have to have some sort of matter to travel through. These waves travel when molecules in the medium collide with each other passing on energy.</advanced>
          <advanced>One example of a mechanical wave is sound. Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves travelling through a spring.</advanced>

        <model section="-1">
          <simple>Transverse waves</simple>
          <advanced>Transverse waves are waves where the disturbance moves perpendicular to the direction of the wave.</advanced>
          <advanced>You can think of the wave moving left to right, while the disturbance moves up and down. One example of a transverse wave is a water wave where the water moves up and down as the wave passes through the ocean.</advanced>
          <quiz>This type of wave causes disturbances perpendicular to the direction of the wave</quiz>

          <simple>Longitudinal waves</simple>
          <advanced>Longitudinal waves are waves where the disturbance moves in the same direction as the wave.</advanced>
          <advanced>One example of this is a wave moving through a stretched out slinky or spring. If you compress one portion of the slinky and let go, the wave will move left to right. At the same time, the disturbance (which is the coils of the springs moving), will also move left to right.</advanced>
          <advanced> Another classic example of a longitudinal wave is sound. As sound waves propagate through a medium, the molecules collide with each other in the same direction as the sound is moving.</advanced>

          <advanced>The amplitude of a wave is a measure of the displacement of the wave from its rest position, in other words, it is how high/low the wave goes</advanced>
          <advanced>In the case of water waves this can be thought of as the height of the wave, the higher the wave the larger the amplitude</advanced>
          <advanced>The amplitude is a measure of the strength or intensity of the wave. For example, when looking at a sound wave, the amplitude will measure the loudness of the sound. The energy of the wave also varies in direct proportion to the amplitude of the wave.</advanced>

          <advanced>They are made up of joined-up sugars. Sugars have the general formula Cm(H2O)n, and are also known as saccharides.</advanced>
          <advanced>Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms, including plants and animals.</advanced>
          <advanced>Carbohydrates are very good for energy, but, if a person eats more than needed, the extra is changed into fat.</advanced>

          <simple>Cellular respiration</simple>
          <advanced>Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a form that the cell can use as energy. </advanced>
          <advanced>Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses for energy. Usually, this process uses oxygen, and is called aerobic respiration.</advanced>
          <advanced>It also produces carbon dioxide as a waste product, which then enters the circulatory system. The carbon dioxide is taken to the lungs, where it is exchanged for oxygen.</advanced>
          <advanced>The equation for this process is Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP)</advanced>
          <advanced>But how do the chemical enter the cell? Let's take a look</advanced>
          <advanced>The process in which particles enter the cell is called diffusion. Diffusion means particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration. This happens naturally, however, the cells membrane can also control what enters and leaves the cell</advanced>
          <advanced>So, the cell membrane allows the particles of some substances to pass through it, but not others. Scientists say that the cell membrane is selectively permeable. </advanced>
          <advanced> One substance that can pass through the cell membrane is oxygen.</advanced>
          <advanced>>This movement of oxygen happens by diffusion, and it happens naturally.  Because the concentration of oxygen is usually higher outside the cell membrane than it is inside. As a result, oxygen simply diffuses into the cell. The cell does not have to do anything.</advanced>
          <advanced>The diffusion of water is vital to the survival and health of cells. For this reason, scientists give it a special name: osmosis</advanced>

          <advanced>The crust is the thinnest layer of our planet. Its average thickness is about 30 km under the continents, but it is only about 5–10 km thick under the oceans. Under big mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains, the crust can be up to 90 km thick. </advanced>
          <advanced>The total distance from the surface of the crust to Earth’s centre is about 6400 km. </advanced>
          <advanced> The soil, plants, and even the oceans that we see on the surface form only a thin covering on the crust. The crust is made of solid rock. </advanced>

          <simple>Continental drift</simple>
          <advanced>Observations led Alfred Wegener to propose the theory of continental drift in about 1912. His theory was that the continents drifted to their current location. </advanced>
          <advanced>He suggested that they started as a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Alfred, like earlier scientists, had noted that the coasts of South America and Africa could fit together. </advanced>
          <advanced>He also saw similar structures along the two coastlines. They share similar rock formations and fossils. He suggested that the drift began about 200 million years ago.</advanced>

          <advanced>There are two kinds of converging boundaries.</advanced>
          <advanced>One kind of converging boundary happens where a trench forms. One plate carries oceanic crust, and the other one carries continental crust. As they push together, the heavier, thinner oceanic crust is forced down below the lighter, thicker continental crust. </advanced>
          <advanced> As one grinds down past the other, earthquakes rumble, and the continental crust wrinkles to form mountains. The oceanic crust moves lower into Earth and gets hotter and melts. This molten rock rises in some places to form volcanoes. </advanced>

          <advanced>Weather happens because different parts of the Earth get different amounts of heat from the Sun. This makes different climates. The tropics get the most heat because the Sun shines straight down on them, while the poles get the least heat because the Sun shines on them from a low angle. </advanced>
          <advanced>Weather is very important to life on Earth, it covers everything from rain, and storms to temperature</advanced>
          <advanced>Meteorology is the scientific study of weather. Meteorologists are people who study and predict, or forecast, the weather. Meteorology began in the 17th century when many instruments were invented to measure different weather conditions.</advanced>

          <simple>Circulatory system</simple>
          <advanced> Your circulatory system, which includes your heart, blood, and blood vessels, works with your respiratory system to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body. </advanced>
          <advanced>Blood flows constantly through hollow tubes in your body called blood vessels.  Two types of blood vessels are arteries and veins. Arteries carry blood away from your heart. Veins carry blood back to your heart. Scientists call the movement of blood around your body circulation. </advanced>

          <advanced>Your heart is an organ about the size of your fist. It is made up of muscle tissue, which can tighten and relax  </advanced>
          <advanced>Make a fist and notice how the muscles in your hand tighten. Now relax your hand.  Do you feel the difference? This is how  heart muscle works. </advanced>
          <advanced>When heart muscle tightens, blood flows out of the heart.  When heart muscle relaxes, blood flows into the heart. </advanced>
          <advanced>The left side of your heart pumps oxygen-rich blood that comes from your lungs to the rest of your body. As your cells use oxygen, they make carbon dioxide and other waste that the blood carries away. </advanced>
          <advanced>Blood is like a server who delivers lunch to your cells and then takes away the leftovers and garbage. The blood carrying wastes returns to the right side of the heart, which then sends it to the lungs. </advanced>
          <advanced>You inhale fresh air, the blood releases its carbon dioxide and picks up more oxygen, and the whole cycle starts all over again. And it all happens in about a minute!</advanced>

          <advanced>Your body needs fuel to grow and to function properly, the same way a car needs fuel to run. Oxygen, nutrients, and water are the fuel for your body.</advanced>
          <advanced> Oxygen comes from the air, and nutrients come from food. Your digestive system breaks down the food so that your body can absorb the nutrients.</advanced>
          <advanced> The main part of your digestive system is a tube about nine metres long. It goes from your mouth to your anus, which is part of your small intestine. Many organs are part of this tube or attached to it. They include your stomach, liver, and intestines. </advanced>
          <advanced> Your digestive system is like a giant food processor: it chops, mashes, and mixes food into a soupy paste. </advanced>
          <advanced>The food’s journey through the digestive system starts in the mouth, when you chew and swallow. Moist pieces of food then travel down your  esophagus and into your stomach, and later into your intestines. There, digestive juices attack the food and break it down into even smaller pieces.</advanced>
          <advanced>Throughout your digestive system, chemicals called enzymes help break down food into nutrients. Some of the chemicals that help your body digest food are made or stored in the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.</advanced>
          <quiz>This system breaks down food so that your body can absorb the nutrients</quiz>

          <advanced> Your brain processes information from your nerves so that you know what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste. Your brain lets you know whether you are hot, or hungry, or in pain. </advanced>
          <advanced>Your brain also sends signals to all the other systems in your body to control your body’s activities, from walking to sweating.</advanced>
          <advanced> Your brain also uses hormones to communicate. Hormones are chemicals that act as messengers between body systems.</advanced>

          <advanced> The bones in your body form a skeleton, or framework, that holds your body up and gives it a shape. Many muscles work together with bones so that you can move, stand, and sit up. These muscles and bones are part of your musculoskeletal system.</advanced>
          <advanced> Your musculoskeletal system also protects the organs and tissues inside your body. </advanced>
          <advanced>Skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to bones. They are held to the bones by tendons.</advanced>
          <advanced>Tendons are long strips of tough tissue. Tendons help your body move but keep your  bones from being pulled too far out of position. You can feel tendons in your ankles and at the back of your knees. </advanced>
          <advanced> A joint is formed where two bones connect,  elbows, knees, and knuckles are all joints. </advanced>
          <advanced>There are 206 bones in the human skeleton. </advanced>
          <advanced>Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones on both sides of a joint. Muscles pull on the bones at a joint to cause movement. Muscles can pull but not push, so muscles often work in pairs to move different parts of your body. </advanced>

          <advanced>Diseases occur when organs or systems are not working properly. If an organ has a disease, has failed (is not functioning at all), or is missing, the body systems it belongs to may not work properly. </advanced>
          <advanced>For example, when someone is having a heart attack, the artery that carries blood to the  heart is blocked. Blood cannot reach the heart and the heart muscle may start to die. If blood cannot reach your heart, your heart cannot pump it out to the rest of your body. </advanced>

          <advanced>For example, if you watch videos of astronauts in space, you will notice that their tools float, and they won't move unless the astronaut pushes or pulls it, at which point it will keep moving until it is stopped</advanced>
          <quiz>This law states that an object will stay at rest, or continue in motion unless acted on by an external force</quiz>

    <simple>Scientific Method</simple>
  <advanced>The scientific method is a logical and structured way of thinking about our world. It focuses on using observations and evidence, instead of just gut feeling and guesses</advanced>
    <quiz>This is a logical way of thinking about our world</quiz>
  </model>
  
    <model>
    <simple>Observation</simple>
  <advanced>Whenever we encounter something we do not have an explanation for, we could consider it an observation.</advanced>
   <advanced>It is important that we try to consider only what is observed, and ignore any previous assumptions or guesses</advanced>
      <quiz>This is the first step in the scientific method</quiz>

    <simple>Experiment</simple>
  <advanced>We use an experiment to try to test our hypothesis. During the experiment, we should try and isolate for only the variables in our hypothesis</advanced>
  <advanced>Our experiment should also be reproducible, such that others can also test our hypothesis</advanced>
        <quiz>This is the fourth step in the scientific method</quiz>
